<SPEAKER ID="006" NAME="President">
I must begin this sitting by passing on some bad news. Firstly, it is my sad duty to inform you of the death of Mr Antoni Gutiérrez Díaz, who was a Member of the European Parliament for many years, from 1987 to 1999.
<P>
As you are very well aware as am I, since I got to know him very well within the context of Spanish political life he was a member of the Communist Group and then the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, of which he was Vice-President from 1992 to 1994.
<P>
Mr Gutiérrez Díaz was also Vice-President of our Parliament from 1994 to 1999 and President of the Committee on Regional Policy, Regional Planning and Relations with Regional and Local Authorities from 1992 to 1994.
<P>
To those of us who knew him, his death is a great tragedy. I believe that political life has lost one of its best representatives.
<P>
I would ask that we observe a minute's silence in memory of our late colleague.
<P>
(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)
