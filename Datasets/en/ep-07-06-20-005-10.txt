10. ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (vote) 
<P>
- Cornillet report
<P>
- Before the vote on paragraph 9:
<SPEAKER ID="116" NAME="Thierry Cornillet " AFFILIATION="ALDE">
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, our fellow Member, Mrs Morgantini, has also tabled an oral amendment and I suggest combining the two. It would, therefore, be a matter of accepting Mrs Morgantini's oral amendment and completing it with the following part sentence: 'and to call upon the international community to ensure the actual implementation of this multinational force'. The two amendments would complete each other to make just one only.
<SPEAKER ID="117" NAME="Luisa Morgantini" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
(IT) Mr President, I would like to say that I am willing to accept Mr Cornillet's proposal.
<P>
(The oral amendments were accepted)
