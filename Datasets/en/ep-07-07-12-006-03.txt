3. Towards a future Maritime Policy for the Union (vote) 
<P>
- Piecyk report
<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="080" NAME="Willi Piecyk " AFFILIATION="PSE">
rapporteur. - (DE) I beg to point out that Amendment 1 should not be placed after paragraph 4 but after paragraph 146; that was agreed with the author of the amendment. This paragraph does not belong at the beginning but at the end of the resolution. I would be grateful if you could arrange for that to be done.
<SPEAKER ID="081" NAME="President">
Our efficient staff have already seen to that.
