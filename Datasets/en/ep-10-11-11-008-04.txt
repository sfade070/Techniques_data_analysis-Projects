Mr President, I would like to make an announcement to the House.
<P>
The Taiwanese Government has informed the Council, via the permanent representations, Parliament and the Commission, that from today, 11 November, it is establishing visa exemptions for Cyprus, Bulgaria and Romania. Consequently, all 27 EU countries can enter Taiwanese territory without a visa.
