<CHAPTER ID="005-06">
6. Transatlantic Economic Council (vote) 
<P>
Before the vote on paragraph 13:
<SPEAKER ID="113" NAME="Erika Mann" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(DE) Madam President, in our deliberations on the joint motion for a resolution which took place on a cross-party basis on Monday, we forgot that the IMF recommendations on financial crises are already available and that it is now a matter of their implementation. I would therefore recommend - and I very much hope that this will have the support of the House - that the following phrase be inserted in the text:
<P>
'To the implementation by both parties of the conclusions.'
<P>
(DE) and then the remainder of the text. There would be no other changes to the text.
<P>
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
