Explanations of vote
<SPEAKER ID="176" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DA) Mr President, establishing an agency for the management of large-scale IT systems - the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac for the comparison of fingerprints - will achieve good synergy effects. It will create economies of scale and enable the highest possible utilisation rate of capital and human resources. As a representative of a Member State that has reservations with regard to cooperation in legal affairs, I am particularly pleased that we have been able to resolve the legal problems concerning the participation of such Member States in the management of the IT systems and their influence in this regard.
<P>
We have clarified the voting rights that the individual Member States are to have in respect of this agency.
<P>
Finally, I would like to say how pleased I am that, with the adoption of this regulation, we will also have tightened up the rules on data protection in connection with data security and on data security in connection with the management of personal data.
<SPEAKER ID="177" NAME="Siiri Oviir" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ET) Mr President, I consider the adoption of this report and the creation of the agency to be extremely important, precisely because of their aim to ensure the functioning and security of Europe's IT systems 24 hours a day. Large-scale IT systems cannot be administered in a haphazard manner, and responsibility for this cannot be granted to those who do not possess the necessary competence. I am naturally very happy about the selection of the new agency's location, as it was Tallinn, the capital of my home country Estonia, that was selected. Here in little Estonia we have excellent knowledge and experience in this field.
<P>
In my opinion it is a good compromise to divide the seat of the agency among two European Union Member States; thus, the headquarters of the agency will be established in Estonia, and the necessary servers will be located in France, here in Strasbourg, where we are today. One of the roles of the nascent agency could certainly be to raise awareness in the area of IT systems and their security through the organisation of training sessions. I supported the adoption of this report, and I have waited for this result for a long time. Thank you.
<SPEAKER ID="178" NAME="Morten Messerschmidt" AFFILIATION="EFD">
(DA) Mr President, I regret to say that I do not entirely share the enthusiasm that previous speakers have expressed with regard to the fact that yet another agency is now being set up in the EU system. Firstly, we as parliamentarians are responsible for the way in which taxpayers' money is used. We are still waiting to see what added value the existing agencies bring, and consequently we do not know what added value the future IT agency will bring either.
<P>
Throughout the EU, we have a whole series of competent research institutes, universities and other institutes that would easily be able to carry out the task that the new IT agency is now being assigned - and without the need to establish new facilities, new frameworks and new institutions. I have therefore voted against setting up this new agency, at least until we know what the added value of the new agencies and, in particular, the existing agencies might be.
<SPEAKER ID="180" NAME="Siiri Oviir" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ET) Mr President, it is important that universal services should be available to all and that they should be more uniform throughout Europe. It is not acceptable to have large differences in quality and price between Member States, and concrete steps should be taken in order to level out those differences.
<P>
There are, for instance, great differences in the area of e-services, Internet quality and price, so that in one Member State there is nearly a complete absence of decent e-services and the Internet is of poor quality and expensive. We must learn from each other's experiences and achievements, and move towards a more uniform level of services. Despite some quality-related problems, the single European emergency number 112 is a good example in this area. I supported the adoption of this report.
<SPEAKER ID="181" NAME="Adam Bielan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, the 112 service is a key instrument promoting the safety of citizens in an organisation as diverse as the European Union. A single emergency number makes it possible for those needing immediate assistance to contact the appropriate services rapidly, regardless of where they are. I am therefore pleased by this service's increasing significance, efficiency and availability, and I believe that we need to continue to support it.
<P>
Another provision which is worthy of note is that concerning the retention of current emergency numbers, which are deeply ingrained and widely used in some Member States, so as to avoid confusion. I agree that linking political strategies and technologies may contribute to the development of new public services using highly developed and specialist applications, such as e-administration, e-health and e-education. The proposal to involve local and regional authorities in technological investments is also important. I therefore support this report.
<SPEAKER ID="182" NAME="Marian Harkin" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, I want to indicate my strong support for the Rapti report. Perhaps my main concern is that, in times of austerity, European citizens look to the EU to help provide a safety net and, while the actions we can take at European level are limited, nonetheless the universal service obligation is a mechanism which can support citizens where market forces have failed. Indeed we have plenty of examples of that happening in recent times, especially where the financial markets have failed European citizens.
<P>
As I said, circumstances have changed and therefore, in that context, we do need to re-evaluate how appropriate existing legislative provisions are for universal service. We need to ensure that the real needs of citizens are met.
<P>
Finally, 112, the European emergency number; it is a great idea, but we must ensure that Member States provide timely, accurate and reliable location information on the 112 service. If we can do that, then a full-scale promotion of the number, a European emergency number, is warranted. Like the universal service obligation, it can be a safety net for citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="184" NAME="Roberta Angelilli" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, we talk with ever increasing frequency about the Single Market Act and the Small Business Act, which are instruments designed to simplify EU legislation regarding small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Their objectives are growth, jobs and consumer protection, not to mention reducing red tape and removing trade barriers.
<P>
Unfortunately, there are still significant amounts of red tape seriously hindering the freedom of SMEs. For example, urban planning sometimes creates a lot of problems for itinerant street vendors operating in public areas, who risk seeing trading spots in market areas being considered as natural resources, or it creates problems for the introduction of new criteria for issuing or renewing concessions, which would be damaging for the entire sector.
<P>
Instead, it would be appropriate for the renewal criteria to be tied to the development of the areas and the professionalism of the traders, which obviously derives from how long they have held the concession, as well as to an assessment of the investments made over the years.
<SPEAKER ID="185" NAME="Anna Maria Corazza Bildt" AFFILIATION="PPE">
Mr President, I am very glad that my report has been voted through with a vast majority. At a time when everybody discusses debt, austerity and economic governance it is important to also put the real economy at the centre of the debate.
<P>
With this report we have recognised the dignity of retail as a driver for growth, competitiveness and jobs. I regret, however, that Parliament did not schedule a debate on this report. Only 40 minutes were given for the rapporteur, the Commission and catch-the-eye. It is in contradiction with the fact that we have put on the political map, for the first time, retail as a driver for growth. It is even more regrettable that there was not a single Social Democrat or a Green in the Chamber during the plenary last night, and that no one asked to take the floor. This is a lack of respect for the 20 million people that are employed in the retail sector, for the SMEs that are struggling to survive.
<P>
It is a very controversial area. We are talking about market dominance. We are talking about access for consumers in remote areas, in town centres, private labels, lots of things that require a debate between political groups.
<SPEAKER ID="187" NAME="Roberta Angelilli" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposed amending regulation aims to update the contents of the text to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection.
<P>
Since the current results of cross-border cooperation on consumer protection are not always satisfactory, it is a good idea to move ahead with a review that reflects recent legislative developments on protecting these very same consumers. Equally positive is the proposal to include a review clause in the regulation, the purpose of which is to urge the Commission to commit to a substantial revision of the current regulation, including broadening its scope.
<SPEAKER ID="188" NAME="Ville Itälä" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FI) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Repo for drafting an excellent report.
<P>
The fact that progress is being made in our endeavours to protect the consumer is highly important for improving the internal market. Although this is a case of a single technical issue, it is an important matter of principle as to how we can improve the way in which we deal with complaints and possible judicial proceedings across borders.
<P>
It was excellent that Mr Repo succeeded in getting a review clause, so that the Commission can monitor the issue closely and produce its next analysis of the situation in 2014. This was a clear victory.
<SPEAKER ID="189" NAME="Siiri Oviir" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ET) Mr President, it is clear that, in the present situation, the latest developments in consumer protection certainly need to be reflected in the updated regulation, and cross-border cooperation in the area of consumer protection needs to become even more effective. Considering the limited resources available, I think it is extremely important for consumer protection priorities, procedures and other rules, including IT devices, to be harmonised so that the system can function and not become excessively fragmented.
<P>
What is most important, however, is our shared objective of ensuring consumer protection as well as fair and honest trade throughout the European Union. I supported the adoption of this regulation, and I would like to thank Mr Repo for the constructive work he has done.
<SPEAKER ID="190" NAME="Adam Bielan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, improvements to consumer protection law are a key tool facilitating a more rigorous enforcement of provisions protecting the interests of the various parties in intra-EU transactions. The obstacles that stand in the way of cross-border cooperation between individual countries need to be abolished, and an analysis needs to be carried out of the additional legislative solutions which are necessary, in order to mount an effective fight against traders engaging in unfair practices which disrupt the efficient functioning of the internal market. This will make it possible to establish clear rules governing the actions of public authorities as regards the identification, monitoring and elimination of violations of consumer protection regulations. In this regard, it is particularly vital to improve the effectiveness of the CPC network's actions by aiming to eliminate flaws in legislation, for example those which mean that a given activity is prohibited in the consumer's country, but not in the supplier's country. Improving the quality of consumer protection laws is one of the most important objectives for the European institutions. We can only develop and extend the EU internal market by increasing consumer confidence. I therefore support measures aimed at enforcing consumer rights more effectively throughout the EU.
<SPEAKER ID="191" NAME="Alfredo Antoniozzi" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, Regulation (EC) 2006/2004 aims to abolish the barriers to cross-border cooperation between public law enforcement authorities to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests.
<P>
As we know, the regulation proposes to achieve its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer protection laws in the Member States.
<P>
In the light of recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, I agree on the need to update the legislation. By removing the irrelevant laws, we will ease consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities. I think the amendments set out in Mr Repo's report will successfully translate our pre-established objectives into reality and improve legal certainty, so I therefore voted in favour.
<SPEAKER ID="192" NAME="Peter Jahr" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Mr President, consumer protection laws are important. The information provided to consumers must be appropriate, readily available and objective. The European Union is an economic union, a union of values and, of course, also a union for consumer rights. This means that we must constantly coordinate our consumer legislation to ensure that consumers can access information and that the laws are followed everywhere.
<P>
I believe that this evaluation report, in which we acknowledge that we are on the right track, is particularly important. We will also remain in constant contact with the Member States and with consumers in order to investigate whether our coordination measures are appropriate or in need of improvement. For this reason, I believe that the evaluation report in 2014 is an essential part of this report. Therefore, I have voted in favour of the report.
<SPEAKER ID="193" NAME="Hannu Takkula" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(FI) Mr President, first of all, I want to thank Mr Repo for an excellent, and, if I may say so, quite brilliant report. It goes without saying that this is perhaps a small step for you, Mr Repo, but it is a big step for the European internal market and European consumers.
<P>
It is important to remember that, when we speak of consumer protection, we are talking about something by means of which we safeguard people's living conditions, and about something which really has an influence in civil societies. The objective and principle in the European Union must be to ensure that the public can have good levels of consumer protection and the correct information on different products and commodities, thus allowing them to live a full life, and one in which they feel protected, with regard to this matter too.
<P>
It is also very important, as far as the internal market is concerned, to ensure that there is forward development in this way. For the internal market to develop, consumers need to have access to reliable and up-to-date information. The follow-up evaluation in 2014 is a good thing, because, if we have a goal and a target, we will also have to act to ensure that it is achieved.
<SPEAKER ID="194" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik" AFFILIATION="PPE">
- (SK) Mr President, current cross-border cooperation in the enforcement of laws protecting the consumer - and that is the key word - is unfortunately highly frustrating, unachievable and almost an abstract concept for many European citizens. The creation of a genuinely effective legal mechanism for the enforcement of laws would therefore clearly increase the confidence of European consumers in the single market, and thus boost cross-border commerce.
<P>
The companies, consumers and bodies responsible for law enforcement need a clear legal framework and a guarantee of legal security in the cross-border enforcement of the acquis in the area of consumer protection. For this reason, I entirely agree that the cross-border enforcement of consumer interests should be put at the forefront of the EU's political agenda.
<SPEAKER ID="196" NAME="Daniel Hannan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, it is one of my longstanding contentions that Shakespeare has something to say about every subject, including our voting list today, starting with our approval of a grant to a steel plant in Denmark.
<P>
'Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me', says the Queen; Act III, Scene II. 'No, good mother, here's metal more attractive', replies the Prince. And here was metal more attractive before we decided to subsidise it; but of course the least attractive metal of all is what is happening to the European currency. Because the result of these repeated interventions, these subsidies, these market distortions is that we are bringing about the same conclusion that we had in the 1970s, when we last pursued these policies. By all means go for the takeover of industry, for the subventions, for the picking of winners, but you will end, as our fathers did, with inflation, with sclerosis, with debt and ultimately in bankruptcy.
<SPEAKER ID="198" NAME="Daniel Hannan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, permanence is the illusion of every age. One of the things that is most striking when you talk to people in the City of London is their belief that somehow there is an entitlement to the pre-eminence that they enjoy, that it is automatic. I am sure that their equivalents in medieval Bruges, Venice or Amsterdam felt the same thing. I can imagine those people as portrayed by the Old Masters with their luxurious furs and their rich, embroidered cloths and their golden chains saying 'no, London does not have the infrastructure to take over from us, we are a natural hub, we are obviously going to be the banking centre of the world'. But bit by bit, as a result of these EU regulations, we are losing our pre-eminence.
<P>
This particular report is only one small chip into the architecture. I think that credit default swaps are an important hedge for some investors, they help optimise capital. But this report on its own is not going to bring the end of the Square Mile. The trouble is that it is part of a barrage of EU legislation covering almost every aspect of financial regulation, the net result of which will be an epochal shift in wealth from Europe to Asia, to the detriment of London specifically but more widely to that of the whole European Union.
<SPEAKER ID="199" NAME="Syed Kamall" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, one of the things that was quite disappointing about the whole debate on short selling was the use of the word 'morality'. My political opponents were saying that surely it was immoral to sell something that you do not own or that you do not yet own.
<P>
On the surface that might strike one to be a compelling argument, but then you have to look at commerce and the way it acts. Farmers and the agricultural sector short sell. They sell the products that they have not yet produced, often seasons ahead. Online companies often do not hold things like books and other products in stock. They sell those products before they have actually got access to them. What is immoral about that short selling as long as there is a reasonable expectation that they can provide that product or service?
<P>
At the same time, governments often short sell when it comes to their bonds, yet my opponents wanted to ban that. Fortunately we did not ban it. What we are trying to ban is uncovered sovereign CDSs where these are used as a proxy hedge on investments in countries that are in trouble. Surely, if we want to create jobs, we should not be banning these things.
<SPEAKER ID="201" NAME="Siiri Oviir" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ET) Mr President, in order to increase the harmonisation of the European market and ensure that it functions in accordance with common values and rules, it is quite certain that we urgently need to adopt the appropriate updated European legislation. Cross-border investors must enjoy the same level of protection across Europe, and harmonising the compensation limit for investors would help to avoid the exploitation of the differences between Member States.
<P>
I think that the rapporteur's recommendation to add the risk principle to the Investor Compensation Scheme Directive is an interesting idea. This would mean that each member's contribution to a scheme would be determined on the basis of the extent of the risk assumed by that entrepreneur. I supported the adoption of this report. Thank you.
<SPEAKER ID="202" NAME="Syed Kamall" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, one of my major concerns about a number of these different compensation schemes is that it almost appears as if we want to regulate away risk. Investors should be practising due diligence so they understand what they are investing in. What worries me about overly prescriptive compensation schemes is that investors will not do their due diligence and will just invest willy-nilly without worrying about the consequences, because they know they will be compensated.
<P>
We have to make sure that investors are informed about the risks that they take. You just cannot eliminate risk altogether, you cannot regulate it away. Investors also have different profiles. Some want no risk: let them be aware of the less risky investments. But those who want to, say, have an adventurous growth model and are prepared to invest money that they may lose should also be allowed to do so. If we try and regulate away risk altogether we will end up affecting the whole investment sector in the EU.
<SPEAKER ID="204" NAME="Francesco De Angelis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I take the view that the Member States should be equipped with a solid legal basis for deciding on the future of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and especially because it needs to be acknowledged that the agricultural and environmental impact - as well as the socio-economic impact - can justify bans and restrictions.
<P>
Indeed, I should like to point out that more than 60% of European citizens are against the development and cultivation of GMOs and that, as it stands, there is still no bedrock of scientific advice capable of dispelling all doubt about their impact on territories, cultures and consumers. Our legislative action must therefore once again be guided by the precautionary principle, because until we are certain that GMOs are not harmful for crops or consumers, we have the duty to protect European citizens from their potential damaging effects.
<SPEAKER ID="205" NAME="Giommaria Uggias" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(IT) Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mrs Lepage for her determined work in bringing this dossier to a positive conclusion. I have been a staunch supporter of this report throughout, partly because I think it gives real legal value to the text we have adopted and also because it fills a legislative vacuum that has given rise to serious legal dispute between enterprises, public bodies and citizens.
<P>
This measure avoids the colonisation of the Member States, leaving them free to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. The amendments that this text brings in will therefore allow the individual Member States to ban the cultivation of GMOs due to the impact they may have on the agricultural system, particularly with regard to biodiversity, but also with regard to pesticide resistance, to the invasiveness of certain crops and, therefore, to the protection of our territories.
<SPEAKER ID="206" NAME="Roberta Angelilli" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because I have always made it clear that I have many doubts about the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in Europe. This is particularly so because European agricultural producers have always focussed on traditional, high quality and excellent products, while aiming to protect consumer health through numerous quality controls and transparent traceability mechanisms.
<P>
In addition, as stated in the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, GMOs cannot be thought of in the same way as any other product: they are living organisms capable of reproducing and multiplying and, secondly, they have an impact on EU's extremely varied systems of production and ecosystems. This is precisely why each Member State must have the right to decide on GMOs.
<SPEAKER ID="207" NAME="Izaskun Bilbao Barandica" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report as it will increase environmental, food and legal security for decisions taken in Europe with regard to transgenic crops.
<P>
The report improves the Commission's proposal because it adds guarantees and specifies the reasons for justifying restrictions at a local level. Its adoption will make it possible for complementary environmental evaluations at local level, contradictory data between local and Community level studies, or the emergence of new data and scientific evidence since the general evaluation was made to justify new restrictions, on a case by case basis, as well as linked to geographical areas.
<P>
Other evaluation factors for authorising these crops, such as soil management, are also incorporated, these factors being closely connected with regulated coexistence between transgenic and non-transgenic crops.
<P>
Finally, I believe it is a good move to change the legal basis and to refer the authorisations of the Treaties to the environmental content, instead of to the clause on the internal market, as it improves legal certainty but, also, transmits values.
<P>
In these very sensitive issues it is better to regulate from the point of view of the environment rather than trade.
<SPEAKER ID="208" NAME="Carlo Fidanza" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, personally I have always taken a very cautious stance on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Indeed, I think that in the absence of scientific evidence assuring their absolute harmlessness to health and in light of serious economic criticisms - particularly in countries with a strong focus on quality and tradition - we need to be guided by the precautionary principle on this issue.
<P>
We are therefore in favour of research whereby all the facts are brought to light but we reject unrestricted introduction ahead of clear, binding and universal rules on coexistence between traditional, organic and genetically modified crops, and on non-contamination. I should also have liked to have seen greater courage from the Commission in setting out a cautious way forward, but there are positive aspects here that we should welcome. In particular, the Commission has taken the unprecedented step of allowing Member States to prohibit the growth of genetically modified organisms on agricultural and environmental grounds, thereby strengthening our legal position in view of possible disputes before the World Trade Organisation.
<P>
That is why I voted in favour of this proposal for legislation.
<SPEAKER ID="209" NAME="Horst Schnellhardt" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have voted against the report, not because I felt that the Commission proposal was wrong, but because I saw an opportunity to get out of the muddle which the Member States currently find themselves in. However, we have decided to do exactly the opposite.
<P>
Several years ago we adopted legislation on genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This clearly specifies the coexistence of the three forms of cultivation: organic, conventional and genetically modified. Now we have decided that we cannot have coexistence for GMOs. That is the decision that is being made today.
<P>
This means that we have taken a decision which contradicts our other previous decisions. Then, on top of that, we say that we need a scientific basis and call the actions of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) into question. After this the Commissioner is asked to restructure the EFSA. Well, my goodness, do we really only believe what we have heard somewhere else about panic and ideological principles? We should stop and think carefully about what we are actually doing here.
<SPEAKER ID="210" NAME="Anna Maria Corazza Bildt" AFFILIATION="PPE">
Mr President, I understand that the issue of GMO cultivation may concern Europe's people, but there is too much emotion in the debate. We have to move from perception and myth to scientific research. It is very important not to undermine the European Safety Agency if it ascertains, on the basis of data and facts, that a specific GMO is safe. It is, of course, necessary to respect the right of Member States to decide how to use their own territory, but I voted against.
<P>
If we enable the cultivation of GMOs to be banned for reasons of public order, ethics or public morality we open a Pandora's box by enabling society to decide what to ban on the basis of what is popular and not what is safe. We need harmonised rules in the European Union based on science.
<P>
In the last ten years, over EUR 200 million has been spent on research and risk assessment and so far no evidence has been found to show that GMO crops are harmful. We have to think about feeding 8 billion people in the world and a future generation. Research has to continue. We have to find modern breeds of crops.
<SPEAKER ID="211" NAME="Siiri Oviir" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ET) Mr President, I am convinced that, regardless of the level of monitoring that is applied, it is a fact that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) do not recognise boundaries between fields or national borders, and a small human error is enough to disturb the natural balance, which may already threaten our biological diversity. I voted in favour of the report, because I consider the decision to permit Member States to limit or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs on their territory to be a positive step.
<P>
It is simply irresponsible to permit GMOs in a situation where there is no direct need for increased agricultural production and there is no certainty regarding their safety, and, I would like to emphasise once again, it may cause irreversible damage. The use of GMOs may indeed increase the scale of production and primarily benefit merchants, but studies have shown that their nutritional value is low, and the use of GMOs makes agricultural producers dependent on the commercial interests of large corporations.
<SPEAKER ID="212" NAME="Peter Jahr" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Mr President, I do not want to conceal the fact that I take a very critical approach to this report and have therefore voted against it. I am concerned that it will result in a patchwork of different regulations in the individual states. There is no possibility of any countries going it alone because products containing genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are already being sold on the internal market. Therefore, Europe will be turning its back on a technology which has enough potential that it is worth researching into it in more detail.
<P>
Genetically modified (GM) crops offer significant opportunities, but also involve risks. This is why we need to have an honest debate on this subject in society and in the business community. For this reason, it is particularly important that we carry out thorough research into this technology and continue to develop it in a responsible way. However, in order to achieve this, we must have permission to do the research. With good reason, Europe has put in place one of the world's most stringent approval procedures. No products containing GMOs will come onto the European market unless it can be guaranteed that they are completely harmless to human health and the environment, because the safety of people and of the environment are our highest priorities.
<SPEAKER ID="213" NAME="Ville Itälä" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FI) Mr President, as we have heard here, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) unquestionably have potential and importance, but we do not have enough information on the risks associated with them.
<P>
I also think that it is a matter of who decides these things, and what motivates them to do so. I myself would like my country, Finland, to be able to decide on as wide a ban as possible, if it so wishes, and not to have to ask for permission separately for each crop. Because of this, for the most part today, I voted differently from most of the members of my group.
<SPEAKER ID="214" NAME="Marian Harkin" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, I too welcome the outcome of the vote on this report. What we are doing here is supporting a proper legal basis whereby Member States, if they choose, can ban the cultivation of GM crops. We are trying to give some legal certainty and it makes no sense if we have one case after another in the Court of Justice. We want to ensure freedom of choice for consumers and farmers and we are trying to do this in a reasonable, practical and workable way.
<P>
I was happy to see some amendments carried from my own group, in particular Amendment 44, where it states that the long-term environmental effects of GMO crops, as well as their potential effects on untargeted organisms, should be rigorously assessed. Also paragraph 47, which came from the ALDE Group, was voted through and it allowed grounds such as the maintenance of local biodiversity and the need to ensure seed purity to be used. Today we have applied the precautionary principle and that is wise. Finally, we asked the Council and Commission to ensure that necessary resources for independent researchers on the potential risks of GMO would be in place, and I think that was a good move on our part.
<SPEAKER ID="215" NAME="Paul Murphy" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
Mr President, I voted in favour of the Lepage report because I oppose the spread of genetically modified organisms. The pro-GMO agenda is driven by six major food corporations led by Monsanto. They are backed up by some of the right wing in this Parliament and other parliaments who have opposed here today the support for even the extremely limited requirement for a risk assessment before authorising a new GMO variety.
<P>
The companies' profits are rising dramatically as their stranglehold over agricultural production is increased. As a result of their control over these seeds, farmers are forced to buy the seeds, causing prices to rise dramatically. They are forced to buy them from these same corporations, as they have no other choice. The environment also suffers through the loss of biodiversity and the growth of weed resistance, which leads to the use of even more harmful pesticides and the crushing of sustainable farming.
<P>
Finally, consumers also suffer from the bad impact on human health of the increased use of chemicals in farming as well as the unknown impact of GM.
<SPEAKER ID="216" NAME="RadvilMorkūnaitė-Mikulėnien" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(LT) Mr President, today we voted on the rather controversial issue of the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). 61% of Europeans consider that GM food makes them feel uneasy, and the same proportion disagree with the idea that the development of GM food should be encouraged. However, it should be recognised that a significant proportion, 21% of Europeans, welcome GMOs and say they believe that GMOs should not have damaging effects on future generations. Like statements that GMOs will resolve the issue of food shortages, the negative or positive impact has yet to be proven either way scientifically. This means that it is impossible to find a one-size-fits-all solution for Member States. The approach in the Member States also varies, therefore the proposal to allow countries themselves to be given the opportunity to restrict the cultivation of GMOs on their territory is completely correct. I therefore voted in favour of the report by Corinne Lepage.
<SPEAKER ID="217" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik" AFFILIATION="PPE">
- (SK) Mr President, we have voted for a directive which makes it possible for Member States to restrict or ban genetically modified organisms (GMOs). There are potential long-term cumulative effects, direct and indirect effects, effects on human health and also environmental effects. As we know, there are also three main reasons, or three categories under which we assess GMOs. These are: environmental issues, including pesticide resistance issues; secondly, socio-economic reasons, as there are costs for decontamination; finally, land-use planning and land management as such. It is necessary to assess the safety risks, as well as the rules on the coexistence of different varieties.
<P>
I am opposed to wasting land in the controversial effort to sow large areas with GMO organisms in order to produce so-called green fuels for motor vehicles. On the contrary, such activities directly increase the price of other foods, while making no particular contribution to the environment. Incidentally, a majority of citizens are opposed to sowing our land with GMOs, and I would rely on the European Food Safety Authority, which produces expert assessments in this area.
<SPEAKER ID="218" NAME="Mario Pirillo" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(IT) Mr President, today we voted on the vexed and controversial issue of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Offering Member States the chance to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory means that the European Union will surrender its leading role on this most delicate of issues.
<P>
Many questions remain to be answered. Do we know what the long-term effects will be on the ecosystem? Are we reasonably sure that the use of GMOs does not carry serious health risks? Are we sure that consumers whose government has banned their cultivation will not find themselves eating them anyway?
<P>
We are a long way from any definitive answers. The only thing I know for sure is that both the Commission and the Member States should guarantee that the necessary resources will be made available for independent research, and that GMOs will not be merely a short-cut to profit.
<SPEAKER ID="219" NAME="Daniel Hannan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, this is precisely the kind of sensitive issue that ought to be dealt with through the national democratic mechanisms and procedures of each state. I quite understand why it is an issue on which tempers run high; a number of my constituents feel that there is something intrinsically eerie about, let us say, a tomato that contains anti-freezing genes taken from arctic fish.
<P>
Personally I do not share those concerns; we have been practising genetic manipulation since Neolithic times. We have created for our convenience breeds which would not survive a day in the wild without human stewardship. If some cataclysm were to eradicate our species it would be the weeds that we have spent thousands of years fighting that would take over and the crops that we have spent thousands of years protecting that would be wiped out.
<P>
For example, we have created cattle that lactate in such quantities that they could not exist without human care; the ancestor of the modern chicken laid something like five eggs a year. But the point is that, wherever I stand on this, it should be up to individual consumers to make the choice themselves or, if we must have regulation, it should be national regulation, answerable through parliaments to people. You would have thought that with what is going on in Europe at the moment we would have had other things to worry about.
<SPEAKER ID="221" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, this has been a very sensitive debate. I think it is fair to say that a number of EU Member States had to review and amend their constitutions to ensure accession to the EU.
<P>
The European Parliament cannot accept one of the Member States bending its constitution in a way that is not in conformity with EU values and fundamental rights. The Hungarian Constitution is alarming for a number of reasons. In particular, the Constitution contains provisions that could lead to discrimination against certain groups in society, namely ethnic, religious and sexual minorities. I am content that we, the European Parliament, have sent a strong message to the Hungarian authorities. We will not accept a Member State that does not explicitly protect all fundamental rights.
<SPEAKER ID="222" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik" AFFILIATION="PPE">
- (SK) Mr President, the Hungarian Constitution is a typical example of how the European Parliament should not get involved in the constitution of another Member State, but since we are debating it, I have to say that my fellow Members from Hungary have done something interesting in defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, and in talking about respect for life from birth to natural death. On this matter, I agree with what Hungary, as a sovereign country, has put into its own Constitution.
<P>
Hungary has failed in other political areas, however, and particularly in terms of demographics, where it needs Hungarians from Slovakia and Romania, and still dreams of rewriting the Treaty of Trianon and promoting the nationalistic dream of a Greater Hungary. The new Hungarian Constitution has strong extra-territorial elements, and it focuses on the promotion of dual citizenship, votes for Hungarians from across the border in elections, the promotion of a specific interpretation of the Kosovo precedent - involving the possibility of violating state and territorial integrity, for example that of the Slovak Republic - and it is anti-European and anti-Slovak, and I have therefore abstained on this issue.
<SPEAKER ID="223" NAME="Diane Dodds" AFFILIATION="NI">
Mr President, as someone who believes in the sovereignty of the nation state, I voted against this motion for a resolution on the revised Hungarian Constitution. Yet again we see the interference of this House in the internal affairs of a Member State, seeking to force its opinion on the Hungarian people. Let us not forget that the democratically-elected parliament of Hungary adopted this new Constitution by more than two-thirds this year. The representatives of the people of Hungary support the Constitution, so what right have we to reject it?
<P>
Sadly, what appears to have motivated such angst in this place is that the Hungarian Constitution is clear in matters about marriage and the family. I for one respect the position of Hungary and reject the attempts of this House to interfere in its internal affairs.
<SPEAKER ID="224" NAME="Marian Harkin" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, while there are some positive statements in this resolution, I have some concerns and could therefore not support it, in particular recital H, which speaks of 'unclear wording when defining basic notions such as "family” and the right to life from the moment of conception'. I have not read the wording, which is described as unclear; however, there are many clear references to the term 'family' in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, indeed, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights which we have recently appended to the Treaty of Lisbon.
<P>
According to Article 33 of the Charter, 'the family shall enjoy legal, economic and social protection'. That seems pretty clear to me. Indeed the word 'family' appears five times in the Charter and six times in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. I know there are many in this House who would like to get rid of the word 'family' but I simply do not support that view.
<P>
Furthermore, the right to life from the moment of conception or not is a matter for Member States to decide. Time and time again we have this useless debate in this House. Member States have the right to make their own decisions on their own territory - I support that. I do not seek to push my pro-life views on other Member States. I believe citizens of all Member States have the right to make their own decisions in this matter, and I am supported on this by the Treaties.
<SPEAKER ID="225" NAME="Anna Záborská" AFFILIATION="PPE">
- (SK) Mr President, the European project is made possible by Member States voluntarily surrendering part of their sovereignty to the European Union. We must respect the voluntary nature of the arrangement, and European institutions should not speak out on issues that fall within the competence of nation states.
<P>
The socialists do not want Hungary to defend the notion of a family made up of a man and a woman, or to protect the life of the unborn child in its Constitution. Tomorrow, they may want Slovakia, for example, to give up the reference to St Cyril and St Methodius, or to enshrine the right to euthanasia or some of the so-called new human rights in its Constitution.
<P>
Some fellow Members call on Hungary to respect the territorial integrity of neighbouring states, although the Hungarian Constitution does not call this into question. Every Member State has the right to adopt the Constitution its citizens consider to be the best. It is the European Court and not the European Parliament that decides on the non-conformity of the laws of a Member State with EU law. I have therefore not supported the resolution.
<SPEAKER ID="226" NAME="Zbigniew Ziobro" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, the adoption of a new Hungarian Constitution has become an excuse for the left-wing and liberal parties in the European Parliament to mount a highly emotional and often even aggressive attack, lacking any substantive basis, on Hungary under Prime Minister Orbán's right-wing government. Leaving aside the issue of whether the European Parliament is overstepping its mandate and competencies and its powers under the Treaty of Lisbon by debating the Constitution of a sovereign Member State, there has been a striking lack of understanding for fundamental ideas such as sovereignty, democracy and tolerance during this debate.
<P>
After all, no one can forbid a sovereign state from referring to God, Christianity and traditional values in its Constitution. No one can dispute the fact that Hungary chose this Constitution by way of a democratic choice by the majority of its people, in free and democratic elections. Finally, tolerance means respect for the views of others, views which we need not necessarily share. Since we expect tolerance, let us also be tolerant. I am appealing here to the representatives of the left-wing and liberal parties in the European Parliament.
<SPEAKER ID="227" NAME="Nicole Sinclaire" AFFILIATION="NI">
Mr President, once again here we have the European Union trying to interfere on matters concerning a national state. It should be the people and a country's elected government who decide matters of national importance, together with conscience. For a period of 45 years the Hungarian people were under Communism and the Supreme Soviet and they decided the daily lives of the people of Hungary and yet here we have the European Union doing the same. Let the people be free; let the people decide. The European Union has no right to decide on Member State issues.
<SPEAKER ID="228" NAME="Jacek Olgierd Kurski" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, in the Chamber today we have witnessed unacceptable interference by the European Parliament in Hungary's sovereign affairs. The attack on the Hungarian Constitution is being used as an excuse by the proponents of European political correctness to take revenge for the existence of an effective conservatism, and to take revenge on the Fidesz party, which is effectively pulling the country out of the bankruptcy to which it was driven by the socialist and post-Communist governments.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Hungarian Constitution represents a return to a world of simple values: marriage is at long last the name given to a union between a man and a woman, the Communist times are at long last called a time of tyranny, and the state is at long last the source of regeneration of the national community. The European Parliament should maybe turn its attention to those countries where democracy is really being violated, such as Poland, for example, where independent journalists who are critical of the authorities are sacked from their jobs, where at 6 o'clock in the morning the special services enter the home of an Internet user who operates a portal which is critical of the authorities, and where the leader of the opposition is ordered to undergo psychiatric tests. Since generations of Hungarians will be proud of their Constitution, it is better for the European Parliament to turn its attention to cases where democracy really is being violated in Europe, such as those in Poland.
<SPEAKER ID="230" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DA) Mr President, over the last year and a half, the European Parliament has tabled numerous reports, energy action plans and energy strategies. We have worked towards setting some ambitious goals in order to create a greener world to live in, but also to create innovation and jobs. The vote that we have undertaken today has made Parliament a complete laughing stock, because we have voted against almost everything that we have voted in favour of over the last year and a half. There is therefore only one positive thing to say about this vote and that is that the whole report was rejected. This means, at least, that the objectives that we have set in the various action plans, strategies and reports in the last year will still remain in place. If the report had been adopted today they would have been superseded by the new, far less ambitious objectives, and that would not have been good for Europe. It is certainly not good for Europe, either, that we are unable to find a way to speak with one voice when we negotiate at international level. It was a disheartening vote that we witnessed today.
<SPEAKER ID="231" NAME="Ville Itälä" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FI) Mr President, as we are discussing here whether the target should be 30% or 25%, I would say that it is probably not difficult to accept that high targets are a good thing. I myself am prepared to accept a 30% target.
<P>
We always have to bear in mind, however, how industry will go along with this. This is about European jobs: if industry cannot keep up, the jobs may go to countries where they are not bothered about percentages at all. In other words, we just need to find a balance.
<P>
We should also remember that, when we are talking about the financial framework and the budget, we need to invest in innovation, to be able to discover the energy-efficient solutions and new innovations that we could employ to reach this target.
<SPEAKER ID="232" NAME="Adam Bielan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, systematic reductions in carbon dioxide emission levels are having a negative impact on the economies of countries such as Poland, which are based on hard coal combustion. The ongoing decarbonisation of the energy sector, which reflects an ambition to entirely eliminate CO2 emissions, may result in a significant economic recession, both in developing countries and in highly developed countries. An increase in energy prices, resulting from necessary changes to the way in which this energy is obtained and associated investments, may contribute significantly to worsening the economic situation of industrial regions. The ambitious standards already in force for exhaust gas emissions from various types of motor vehicle increase transport costs, and mean that manufacturers need to spend more on innovations. The introduction of high targets for greenhouse gas emission standards will make it necessary to use EU funds to subsidise a significant number of enterprises. I therefore remain sceptical about the possibility of increasing the 20% target for reducing emissions gases.
<SPEAKER ID="233" NAME="Peter Jahr" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Mr President, I have three comments to make about this report. The first is that I think it is highly regrettable that we are claiming that there is one cause of climate change and are only looking at CO2 emissions. Scientific studies show that CO2 is not the sole cause.
<P>
Secondly, during the process of reducing CO2 emissions to a minimum, we should also be considering the efficient use of resources and consumption. It is still important to manufacture products using as little energy as possible and not only to focus on CO2 emissions.
<P>
Thirdly, I am in favour of setting ambitious objectives, but they must also be realistic. In addition, we must work together because we only have one planet and it belongs to all of us. It will be useless if measures are taken to reduce production in one country or in one industry and the same production then takes place elsewhere with much higher levels of emissions.
<SPEAKER ID="234" NAME="Hannu Takkula" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(FI) Mr President, regarding this report by Mr Eickhout, I want to say that we certainly all agree that we have to do our best to cut greenhouse gas emissions.
<P>
We in Europe are committed to the EU's 20-20-20 target, and this is enough. We need to insist that the rest of the world should be involved in all this. We must remember that Europe's emissions are around 10% of those for the whole world. If we consider European jobs and industry, we have to ensure that they can be kept here.
<P>
If we establish new, tighter targets every year, industry will not be able to respond to them. We have to establish clear targets and objectives, such as the 20-20-20 target, and go with them, instead of jumping from one to another, causing uncertainty. We need European industry: it is committed to the 20-20-20 targets; and we should keep to that and, furthermore, persuade the rest of the world to be involved in environmental cooperation.
<SPEAKER ID="235" NAME="Zbigniew Ziobro" AFFILIATION="ECR">
- (PL) Mr President, greenhouse gases know no borders. Although this would appear to be an obvious point, it appears to have been missed by those in favour of a radical reduction in emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
<P>
The European Union is striving to achieve a radical reduction in greenhouse gas emissions within its own borders, turning a blind eye to the fact that other countries such as China, India and the former Soviet states do not have the slightest intention of doing the same, and instead are increasing production, and at the same time increasing emissions. Why is the European Union implementing such a policy, and what are the consequences? It is merely resulting in production being transferred from Europe to countries outside the European Union, which means that jobs are transferred and taxes lost. Yet intensive, CO2-emitting production is still going on in China, in India and in South American countries, which means that there is still just as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as there was before, if not more. This is a road to nowhere.
<SPEAKER ID="236" NAME="Daniel Hannan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, the problem with this report can be very simply stated. It is declamatory. I am not a climatologist. I am not qualified to pronounce definitively on sunspots or sea levels or the medieval warm period. Like almost everyone else in this Chamber I am dealing with secondary reports and I am doing my best to weigh up the opinions of people who have done the research themselves.
<P>
But I am an elected legislator and I think it would be negligent not to have a view on what constitutes a proportionate response to an identified problem. It is here that this proposal fails the test. The proof of that can be found in the claims that its supporters are making. They do not argue that this reduction, adopted unilaterally in Europe, would have more than a negligible impact on global warming on their own predictions. They say that they have to send a message. They have to show us that they are united. They have to encourage others by their actions. In other words they are using legislation not to achieve an identified outcome but to show what nice chaps we are and to feel good about themselves. If you want to do that, buy the awareness ribbon. Wear the armband or put solar panels on your roof. Do not expect your constituents to pick up the bill for you.
<SPEAKER ID="237" NAME="Nicole Sinclaire" AFFILIATION="NI">
- Mr President, I am not convinced that the target of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 is achievable. I would therefore question the wisdom of increasing the budget to 30% and placing substantial extra costs on the industry at a time of economic hardship. Issues of climate change and global warming are of great importance not just to Europe, but to the whole planet and for future generations to come. More than anything we need to increase our understanding of the phenomenon that we are facing. In this respect we still have a long way to go.
<P>
I think that bandwagon jumping, and therefore attention-seeking, by politicians eager to please the global warming alarmists, will be no more helpful than dubious pronouncements by the deniers, who may or may not be emissaries of oil-company money. I have therefore not voted on this report, nor do I feel able to report on it, or support it. I think that we need to know more before we commit ourselves to the cost of tampering with the arbitrary targets we therefore cannot meet, in order to grab headlines.
<SPEAKER ID="238" NAME="Jacek Olgierd Kurski" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, I welcome Parliament's decision today to reject the proposal to increase the CO2 emissions reduction target to 30%. Even the 20% reduction target is lunacy. There is no scientific evidence that humans have a decisive impact on global warming. Nature itself regulates climate change; sometimes the climate is warmer, and sometimes it is cooler. This is why Greenland is under a layer of ice today, contrary to what one might suppose from its name. One eruption of volcanic ash can in many cases cause more CO2 emissions than the annual emissions of the national economies of several European countries.
<P>
Why are we bleeding ourselves dry, when Europe emits only 15% of global CO2, and the rest of the world has no interest in reducing its emissions? For countries such as Poland, where 94% of energy is generated from coal, it would be suicidal to adopt this package. It might mean that the amount Poland has to spend on reducing CO2 emissions exceeds the total net amount it receives from the EU Structural Funds. I hope that today's decision is a step in the right direction: as we are abandoning the 30% target, we should also abandon the 20% target. This problem should be a priority for the Polish Presidency.

(IT) Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper on the post-2013 cohesion policy reduces the effects of a two-speed Europe. Indeed, only uniform growth can ensure proper cohesion between our territories and overall unity, even in diversity.
<P>
I voted in favour of the text because it introduces an intermediate category, which allows may European regions to continue to benefit from the same amount of structural funds as they have done so far. The lack of efficient programming for the use of European funds has unfortunately resulted in many regions being unable to make proper use of the resources made available by the European Union, thereby risking a majority of the funds being left unused. Here, however, Brussels is sending out a positive message. We hope that our regions will know how to interpret and use the funds in the best possible way.
<SPEAKER ID="241" NAME="Mario Pirillo" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(IT) Mr President, there is huge anticipation for the legislative proposals on the forthcoming post-2013 cohesion policy, which will be tabled in September. The Commission has already announced that this reform will see the introduction of an intermediate category, which should replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out.
<P>
I am left perplexed by the implications that this new category will have, since it will also include - or at least seems to include - the regions that currently are neither converging nor competing. I should like to point out that the priority of the cohesion policy is to assist late-developing regions, and I therefore would not want the reform to damage precisely the poorest regions of Europe, which struggle to put development policies into action.
<P>
I hope, however, that the new programming can give European growth a kick-start.
<SPEAKER ID="242" NAME="Ville Itälä" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FI) Mr President, the cohesion and structural policies are extremely important tools with which to even out disparities in Europe.
<P>
One important thing is that, although the number of errors and cases of abuse has fallen, it is still very significant. The money has not been returned, and, in some Member States, the figures are quite staggering. This needs to change, and money has to be used far more efficiently.
<P>
The whole notion of structural policy will obviously lose credibility if people are constantly reading about these cases of abuse. There is considerable loss of reputation regarding how all this works, and I therefore hope that we can continue to pay close attention to efficiency and better budgetary control.
<SPEAKER ID="243" NAME="Erminia Mazzoni" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Mr President, the report by Mr Pieper is certainly worthy of praise. I think that many countries such as Italy, which end up being both major contributors and major beneficiaries of the cohesion policy, will see this report and this work as hugely important.
<P>
The revision is designed, above all, to improve the assessment of results, controls and conditionalities. This approach is certainly worthy of support and is also significant, as long as the budget structure and above all gross domestic product as the main criterion remain in place.
<P>
There are two aspects that I cannot say I agree with. Firstly, there is the surreptitious insertion of the use of additional languages other than those of the proposing or programming entity: I sought an oral amendment to paragraph 5, which makes it mandatory for programmes and projects to be presented not only in the relevant national language but also in English, French and German. This is not acceptable.
<P>
My second issue is with the intermediate categories: I do not think that they are useful for helping those countries in the greatest difficulties, which ought to be the main aim of the cohesion policy.
<SPEAKER ID="244" NAME="Francesco De Angelis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(IT) Mr President, this is a good report and one that is very important for the balanced, harmonious and sustainable development of our communities.
<P>
Genuine solidarity between Member States allows our regions to be more attractive, more innovative and more competitive. Simplifying access to assistance, more effective controls and quality spending are the objectives for a better functioning of this instrument. We need greater investment in research, knowledge and innovation to boost growth, the development of small and medium-sized enterprises and employment.
<P>
I have one final comment: creating a new intermediate category must not result in existing categories being deprived of resources, but must introduce and aim solely and exclusively at the deployment of additional resources.
<SPEAKER ID="245" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik" AFFILIATION="PPE">
- (SK) Mr President, the current threshold for obtaining assistance between the objectives of convergence and competitiveness is clearly set at 75% of Community GDP. I completely agree with the rapporteur's view that a new general category based on funding and based on a GDP level of 75% to 90% is contrary to the key philosophy of EU cohesion policy, which ought to support the weakest regions by means of a horizontal approach.
<P>
In connection with the introduction of a new category of regions, there is also no plan to increase resources, which could result in a situation where converging regions that are struggling the most with structural, economic and social problems have to make savings after 2013 in favour of more developed regions to which the convergence objective would no longer apply under the current criteria. This would have a negative effect on as many as 50 regions, in which 72 million citizens live, causing inequality between the regions to persist.
<SPEAKER ID="246" NAME="Marian Harkin" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, first of all I want to congratulate the rapporteur because I believe that a well-funded cohesion policy sends the right message to European citizens when the word solidarity and the principle of solidarity have certainly been sorely tested right across the EU.
<P>
In particular today I am pleased that we supported Amendment 34, which calls for the creation of regions in the intermediate category. This will help to avoid unequal treatment of regions that no longer come under the convergence objective. Given the extremely severe impacts of the economic and the financial crisis on citizens and on regions, it is very important to ensure that we have an appropriate and a proportionate response. Furthermore, in certain regions the impact of the economic and the financial crisis has been particularly severe, for example in my own region, the Border, Midlands and West of Ireland. In that context it is crucial that the most up-to-date information is used so that policies in place from 2013 onwards reflect and react to the actual situation on the ground, not the situation of a few years ago. It makes no sense to use out-of-date information, so we must ensure that we do not do that.
<SPEAKER ID="247" NAME="RadvilMorkūnaitė-Mikulėnien" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(LT) Mr President, when talking about cohesion policy having greater added value for the European Union and expressing doubts as to whether some projects could be implemented at national or regional levels, we must see the bigger picture. The reality is that a lot of European Union Member States have yet to achieve the European Union average. I come from Lithuania, a country which has been receiving assistance since it first joined the Union in order to eradicate these disparities, and I can see how my country is changing. In Lithuania, it is precisely EU money that is helping to implement a large proportion of new projects that are improving people's quality of life, whether we are talking about the environment, transport or social affairs. Nevertheless, we still have a long road to travel before we reach the EU development average. However, if we simply rely on our own efforts and money, it will not be possible for us to take this road. A sufficient level of financing must therefore be guaranteed post 2013 for those Member States that recently joined the European Union - only then, by showing solidarity, will we ensure balanced development in the European Union.
<SPEAKER ID="249" NAME="Syed Kamall" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, a few years ago I ran a workshop in the Côte d'Ivoire which was attended by young centre-right African politicians. One of the things that we talked about during this workshop was the whole issue of aid. One of the issues that they were most united in opposing was this idea of direct budgetary support. Many of the young activists there said to me that the problem with direct budgetary support was that it actually kept corrupt governments in power. What they wanted was more accountable aid.
<P>
And so we had an interesting discussion about aid. They said that they would in fact rather have less aid so they could help themselves. I explained that the EU and the British Government were insisting on giving more aid and we had a debate about what it should be spent on. They asked for help so that farmers could meet EU sanitary standards, investment in infrastructure, investment in land and property registers, lending capital to entrepreneurs, and mortgage finance so that people could leverage the equity in their home and create a property-owning democracy. The debate should be focused on helping people to help themselves, rather than helping corrupt governments stay in power.
<SPEAKER ID="250" NAME="Martin Kastler" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have voted today on the report by Mr Goerens and I believe that this report is moving in the right direction. For the first time in the history of the European Union, we have done away with the unquestioning belief in budget support in the field of development aid. This means that for the first time we have stated in a report that we should not simply give money to administrative bodies, to states or to governments without sanctions and without criteria that can be monitored. This is the right way forward.
<P>
However, in my opinion one thing is missing. This concerns an amendment which I have tabled and which was unfortunately voted down. The amendment stated that we in the European Union must impose sanctions when a state can be proved to have disregarded the criteria which form the basis for the provision of development aid. We must change this situation so that we can maintain our credibility and make it clear to our voters and our taxpayers what we are spending development aid on.
<SPEAKER ID="252" NAME="Francesco De Angelis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(IT) Mr President, I voted in favour of the report by Mr Sosa Wagner because it effectively highlights the strengths and weaknesses in the European Commission's approach to revitalising energy infrastructures: the need to identify the infrastructures required, the criteria for selecting projects of European interest in view of financing that will attract and boost private investment, the urgent need to deal with the dangers in Eastern Europe of relying on a single source which, as we have seen in recent years, can cause serious supply problems, and lastly the opportunity to invest part of the EUR 1 000 billion over 10 years provided for by the Commission for the reduction of pollution, combating climate change and improving supply quality for clean and safe energy.
<SPEAKER ID="253" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DA) Mr President, the major challenges that we are facing in the field of energy are, of course, fairly familiar to us all: climate and security of supply. The challenge with regard to infrastructure has perhaps not been so prominent in the debate. Our energy infrastructure is outdated and it is simply not designed for supplying green energy from many different energy sources. Without a modern infrastructure we cannot build as many windmills and biogas installations. There is no point if we cannot get the energy out to the end user - that is self-evident.
<P>
At the same time, we have the problem that our infrastructure is not linked together across our borders. After 30 years of underinvestment, we need to make a quantum leap - a leap that will require EUR 230 billion by 2020, which the market will have to provide - quite simply because there is not enough public money for it and because it is in fact the market's responsibility.
<SPEAKER ID="254" NAME="Zbigniew Ziobro" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Mr President, it is to be welcomed that this report has been drafted, but one cannot help but notice its significant shortcomings. The report lacks concrete and tangible incentives for the construction of the Nabucco gas pipeline. This is an extremely important project, which if implemented would provide us with an opportunity to gain independence from Russian energy sources, and which would give us a great deal more certainty as regards Europe's energy security. Unfortunately, if we do not move from words to deeds, and if the European Union does not involve itself with the development of this project, it may never happen. This could mean that the European Union's energy security suffers a significant setback, which will also have economic ramifications, since gas which comes from a monopoly holder will be more expensive, and so creating competition is also justified from the point of view of the market.
<P>
The report makes no mention of the construction of a Sarmatia pipeline, although this is a good idea, and it makes no mention at all of the huge reserves of shale gas in Europe, for example in Poland, even though their extraction would mean that the European Union gained independence in terms of energy security. It is worth extracting this gas, and it is worth thinking about related infrastructure for the future.
<SPEAKER ID="255" NAME="RadvilMorkūnaitė-Mikulėnien" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(LT) Mr President, I welcome the balanced and comprehensive report provided by my colleague Sosa Wagner, which reflects important aspects such as the unconditional nature of an assessment of the environmental impact of new projects. In addition, the call to ensure that third countries meet international environmental and other obligations when implementing new energy projects, has not been forgotten. Proposals are put forward on how to move towards an efficient and flexible European super-grid that reduces CO2 emissions.
<P>
I would nevertheless underline that in order to establish an integrated and competitive European internal energy market by 2014 at the latest, it is not enough to simply implement legislation and guarantee regulation. An EU internal market cannot function fully or efficiently without the full integration of energy islands into the EU power system through new interconnections in infrastructure.
<P>
It is therefore necessary to provide a consistent inventory of existing and lacking infrastructure and to establish measures, facilitating the full implementation, in a physical sense, of an integrated energy market by 2014. Missing infrastructure should be one of the important criteria for determining the hierarchy of projects of European interest.

(DA) Mr President, it was very interesting in the discussions concerning Hungary to hear various Members here proclaim that the Member States independently have a right to contravene the Treaty and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I have to say that this is very interesting, and I strongly disagree, whereas I could perhaps reach agreement with some of my fellow Members in another area that also concerns sovereignty, namely that of social welfare provision. This De Rossa report is clearly an echo of Radio Tirana: the development of one big European socialist welfare state. As a Liberal, I have to firmly reject that. I therefore also chose to vote against the report today, which - even if the worst of the thistles have been weeded out - in spirit is nevertheless heading in a completely different direction, namely the socialist direction. That has been tried before and it is not to be recommended.
<SPEAKER ID="258" NAME="Izaskun Bilbao Barandica" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(ES) Mr President, I voted in favour of this report because it thoroughly examines the definition of social services of general interest. They are not an expenditure, they are an investment as far as people and distributive justice are concerned. Therefore, Member States are urged to provide universal and standardised access to them, and to ensure that it occurs under the same conditions in boom times and at times of economic downturn.
<P>
This is because, in line with the above, this report emphasises the impact that the delivery of these services has on the economy through the jobs they provide, the gross domestic product they generate and the environment they provide in order that other sectors, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), can function. Delivery of these services is essential for equality and to achieve a work-life balance. Lastly, there is the impact created through the commitment to the social economy when liberalisation of these services is the chosen option.
<P>
It is better for capital to be simply a tool of social services providers rather than their ultimate goal. In this way, it is guaranteed that the surpluses are reinvested in quality and innovation, and in improving the service.

in writing. - (SK) The single market in aviation in the European Union was set up legislatively in such a way that the rights established in the aviation sector would be applied mainly for the benefit of passengers. We now have lower prices and the option of choosing from a greater number of transport providers than at any time in the past. The EU has also taken steps to increase air transport safety, compiling a list of airlines that have been shown to be unsafe and that have been forbidden or restricted in EU countries. It provides passengers with special rights in the event that their flights are disrupted in some way - such as delays or flight cancellations - or where seats have been oversold. EU legislation takes responsibility for lost, delayed or damaged baggage. New rules have also been established for protecting physically disabled people and people with reduced mobility against discrimination, and for providing the necessary in-flight assistance. The EU also undertook these legislative measures in order to ensure the proper treatment of passengers in air transport, for example.

I need only refer to the recent information campaign by the European Commission on the rights of disabled passengers and passengers with reduced mobility travelling by air; information posters were put up in airports, and an appealing television advertisement was even filmed. Unfortunately, no mention was made of a large group of travellers who belong to the category of passengers with reduced mobility, namely mothers or fathers travelling on their own with small children.

The European Union has set up the appropriate legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market, and has established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Given the enormous impact of the global financial and economic crisis on European industry, in 2009 the scope of the EGF was broadened in order to provide support to workers made redundant as a result of the crisis. In this instance, Denmark has requested assistance in respect of cases concerning 1356 redundancies (of which 950 are targeted for assistance) in the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard operating in shipyard sector in the municipality of Odense located in southern Denmark. As the application fulfils the criteria, I welcome the call to provide the required assistance to people made redundant as quickly and efficiently as possible.

in writing. - The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of significant changes in the structure of international trade, and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market. Since 1 May 2009, the remit of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic, financial and social crisis.
<P>
At this time, when we are facing this severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which is an increase in unemployment, the EU needs to use all of the means at its disposal to react, particularly with regard to providing support for those who find themselves without a job from one day to the next. I therefore voted for this report on the mobilisation of the EGF in favour of Denmark, with the aim of supporting the 950 workers made redundant from the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard, operating in the shipbuilding sector.

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is an instrument intended to assist in the reintegration of workers who have lost their job due to the ongoing globalisation of world markets.

The fund is for workers and does not aim to benefit the business that made the redundancies in any way. In terms of mobilising the fund for the case in question, I abstained in the vote because I think it presented some critical issues and the eligibility of the request was not all that clear. Indeed, even though the Commission had approved the request, some aspects made me to lean towards abstaining. For instance, it was not a surprise that the workers were made redundant, given that almost a year had passed since the announcement of the closure of the site to the request to mobilise the fund. Furthermore, 750 of the 950 workers who would have been targeted for assistance from the fund had already been hired by a Norwegian firm for offshore activities.

<SPEAKER ID="275" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
The structural changes in world trade patterns and the financial crisis that is currently plaguing Europe continue to be felt, and they justify the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). This time, more than 1 300 workers from the Danish shipbuilding sector have been made redundant due to these problems. I regret the frequency with which such situations arise and I believe that policy makers should pay close attention to them and seek to mitigate their impact whenever possible, in such a way as to prevent workers from being left without a modicum of social protection, while also ensuring that this does not preclude, but rather encourages, their reintegration into the labour market. The way in which the personal circumstances of anyone who is made redundant worsen indicates that this additional support should be provided as soon as possible.
<SPEAKER ID="275" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
The mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is fully reasoned and justified in this case concerning the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard operating in the shipbuilding sector in the municipality of Odense, located in the Region of Southern Denmark, which has been affected by the phenomenon of globalisation, as it has already lost substantial market shares to Asia, and due to the current financial and economic crisis, which has resulted in cancelled orders and a decrease in new orders. I would like to stress that the total amount of EUR 14 181 901 requested may be vital to the reskilling of many of the 1 356 workers who have been made redundant, with a view to their professional retraining in future-oriented and innovative areas of work that will allow the workers to build on their technical knowledge and work experience, especially in the areas of energy technology, construction and landscaping, and robotics.
<SPEAKER ID="276" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Every new application to mobilise this fund increases the urgency of the measures that we have been advocating, which are aimed at fighting unemployment effectively, boosting economic activity, eradicating jobs with no security, and reducing working hours without cutting pay. These measures are the opposite of the policies that have been implemented in the EU, as is happening in Portugal under the European Union and International Monetary Fund plan, the result of which has been more unemployment and the economic recession.
<P>
This time, the request for mobilisation is to assist 1 356 workers who have been made redundant from the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard operating in the shipbuilding sector in the municipality of Odense, located in the Region of Southern Denmark. According to the report, of these workers only 950 are targeted for assistance. It is also worth remembering that hundreds of workers at the shipyards of Viana do Castelo were recently threatened with redundancy, so I welcome their just struggle to keep their jobs. As we approve this mobilisation, I cannot avoid reiterating that what is needed is a clear break with the policies and guidelines that are causing the obvious economic and social disaster seen in several EU countries. Once again, palliatives are needed for the disaster, but the causes must also be addressed.

This is the fifth request to be reviewed within the framework of the 2011 budget, and relates to the mobilisation of a total sum of EUR 14 181 901 from the EGF for Denmark. It relates to 1 356 workers - of whom the assistance applies to 950 - who were made redundant from the company Odense Steel Shipyard, which operates in the shipbuilding industry in southern Denmark. In accordance with the Commission's assessment, the request fulfils the entitlement criteria set out in the Regulation on the EGF, and the Commission recommends that the budgetary authority should approve the request.

It was based on the intervention criterion of Article 2(a) of the EGF Regulation, which requires at least 500 redundancies over a four-month period in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers and downstream producers, and was submitted within the deadline of 10 weeks.

<P>
The fund may not exceed a maximum amount of EUR 500 million per year. We think a number of aspects need to be taken into consideration, including: the link between the redundant workers and major structural changes in international trade patterns or the financial crisis; identification of the dismissing enterprises and of the workers targeted for assistance; the territory concerned with its respective authorities and stakeholders; the impact of the redundancies as regards local, regional or national employment; the coordinated package of personalised services to be funded; dates on which the personalised services to affected workers were started or planned to start; procedures for consulting the social partners; management and control systems.

I welcome the approval of the request, which is justified by the loss of market share of European shipping, in favour of 950 redundancies made by the Odense Steel Shipyard, a large company operating in international shipping.

Leaving aside this particular case, I think that in the future revision of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) it will be important to bear in mind the conduct of multinational enterprises, the relocation of which causes redundancies and the consequent intervention of the EGF, while not compromising workers' access to the support provided.

However, the little that is being given may help to ease their pain. This does not make the rationale of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund any less intolerable.

The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of this. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and those affected by company relocations that occur within a globalised context. More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, which is having a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights. The EGF aims to help workers who are affected by company relocations, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Denmark, which has applied for assistance for 1 356 cases of redundancy, of which 950 are targeted for assistance, at the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard in the shipbuilding sector in the municipality of Odense, in the Region of Southern Denmark.

However, I wish to point out that certain changes are required in the way that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund works, specifically in relation to the allocation of funding, since small countries such as Latvia and Estonia cannot make use of the opportunities the fund offers because the criteria for allocation are such that only large countries, and thus large companies, can benefit from it.

I naturally fully support the altogether justified application from Denmark's Odense Steel Shipyard, but as we Europeans set new objectives, we should seriously consider whether we truly need such large merchant fleets and ports to transport large quantities of goods from distant Asia, or whether it would instead be more sensible to concentrate on production in Europe, which would increase employment and would also be much more environmentally friendly.

Indeed, all the criteria for the intervention of the fund, allowing the mobilisation of up to EUR 500 million per year, have been fulfilled.

I would note, in addition, that the Joint Declaration of Parliament, the Council and the Commission adopted during the conciliation meeting of 17 July 2008 confirmed the importance of ensuring a fast process, in accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement, for the adoption of decisions relating to the mobilisation of the fund.

in writing. - (DA) I voted in favour of the report in respect of those workers who were promised retraining and further training in connection with the mass redundancies at the Lindø shipyard. My vote does not mean that I support the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. On the contrary, I believe that the EU's subsidy system, whereby rich EU countries give money to the EU so that the EU can then give money back to them, is absurd. The Lindø case illustrates this very clearly. There have been many months between the municipalities affected sending the application to the EU and the money now being on the way to Fyn. In the meantime, some of the redundant workers have found work again. That is a good thing, but the many redundant workers who have not found work have not received a penny for the further training and retraining that they were promised. Everyone knows that the longer it goes on, the harder it becomes to find work again. If this money had been paid out straight away by the Danish State without it having to do a circuit around Brussels, it would have been worth a lot more than it is now.
<SPEAKER ID="283" NAME="Csanád Szegedi" AFFILIATION="NI">
in writing. - (HU) I definitely supported and voted in favour of the report. The fact that employees of the shipyard mentioned earlier were dismissed is a direct consequence of globalisation. I agree with the proposal that these people receive assistance from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. This action has to establish a precedent; we have to draw the attention of the society to the harmful effects of globalisation this way as well. This case too proves that profit-oriented multinationals and companies expanding all over Europe as a result of globalisation do not serve the interests of society, and their presence on the market eliminates more workplaces than it creates. I hope that Hungarians losing their jobs in massive numbers, particularly those in North-Eastern Hungary, who have been out of work for some time now, will soon receive similar financial assistance.

Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) with the aim of supporting workers who lose their jobs due to structural changes in the context of the global economy. In 2011, the EGF has a total budget of EUR 500 million. The Commission considers that EUR 14 181 901 should be allocated to Denmark in order to assist the reintegration into the labour market of the 1 356 workers made redundant from the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard. I am voting in favour of this report as I believe that the legal conditions set out in the aforementioned regulation are fulfilled, and that there is a direct causal link between the redundancies and the major structural changes that have been seen in the patterns of world trade. I should also like to point out that the EGF should not be a substitute for the legal and financial responsibilities of the enterprise Odense Steel Shipyard, but rather an additional support granted by Europe in order to reduce the social difficulties that these workers will face. In view of this, I believe that the fund should be extended to this shipbuilding company in the municipality of Odense, in the Region of Southern Denmark, as quickly as possible.

The aim of the European Union Solidarity Fund is to assist regions that have been hit by natural disasters. The torrential rainfall of August and September 2010 caused huge losses in Croatia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia, and led to an application for the mobilisation of the fund by these three countries, on the basis of what is classed as an 'extraordinary regional disaster'; in other words, assistance following a disaster that affects the majority of the region's population and that has serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and economic stability in the region. I believe that the EU should not cease to offer its support to these three countries and thus seek to mitigate the huge losses that they have suffered. Solidarity and cohesion are essential values in a Europe that expresses a wish to be more than a mere economic free trade area.

As a result of severe rainfall in August and September of last year, various regions of these countries suffered heavy losses to infrastructure, businesses, homes and farms. These were extraordinary natural disasters which needed to be overcome quickly, so as to minimise the impact on the living conditions of the people affected and on economic stability in the region. In view of this, I would like to highlight the need to ensure greater flexibility and speed in the procedures for implementing the EUSF.

The total direct damage caused by these floods in all the countries concerned amounts to more than EUR 700 billion. The Commission has proposed releasing resources totalling EUR 19.54 million from the EU Solidarity Fund. Slovenia requested assistance from the Solidarity Fund in connection with flood damage resulting from the intensive rain, which inundated 137 Slovene villages and caused widespread damage to infrastructure, businesses and private property. Croatia requested assistance from the Solidarity Fund after the intense rainfall lasting from 17 to 22 September 2010 caused major floods. The disaster resulted in considerable damage to infrastructure, agriculture and private property. The Czech Republic requested assistance after unusually heavy rainfall in the north of the country caused rivers to swell at the beginning of August 2010, forcing the inhabitants to abandon their homes and causing damage to infrastructure, private dwellings, agriculture and businesses. Once it had verified that all of the applications met the criteria for entitlement within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, the Commission proposed mobilising the Solidarity Fund in order to mitigate the destructive consequences of the natural disasters in these countries.

The torrential rain which hit Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic in September 2010 caused enormous losses. Many people were left without a roof over their heads and lost their life's possessions. The economies of these countries also suffered greatly. This is a huge tragedy, and a problem which is not unheard of in my own country, since Poland has also battled floods. Very large outlays are needed to deal with the effects of flooding, and the process often lasts for years. I believe that it is necessary to mobilise the EU Solidarity Fund, and that assistance should be provided to countries hit by a natural disaster.

The disaster caused significant damage to infrastructure, to the agriculture sector, to businesses and to private property, forcing the population to abandon their homes. We believe that since this was a natural disaster, the request should be examined on the basis of the so-called 'extraordinary regional disaster' criterion. Under this criterion, a region can exceptionally benefit from assistance from the fund where that region has been affected by an extraordinary disaster, mainly a natural one, affecting the majority of its population, with serious and lasting repercussions on living conditions and the economic stability of the region.

in writing. - (RO) The European Union's Solidarity Fund is an essential financial support instrument for managing the natural disasters caused by flooding in Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic. The natural disasters which struck the three European countries resulted in loss of human life and considerable losses for Europe's regional economies, which will have an adverse social and economic impact. Unfortunately, the losses of human life are irreplaceable. However, even in this context, it is obvious how important it is to make a commitment at European level to provide a rapid reaction force and guarantee well-coordinated, prompt action from the intervention teams. Information and education campaigns on the preliminary action to take, during and after disasters have occurred, as well as efforts to encourage people to think prevention must feature among the measures for managing disasters at Member State level. I come from Romania where more than 900 000 fellow citizens live in areas at high risk of flooding and which was among the countries badly hit by severe flooding in 2010. As a European and Romanian, I support the policy of solidarity in every area. However, particularly when we are faced with disasters, solidarity is not an option but a necessity.

The Commission has proposed mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic in accordance with Point 26 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. This agreement allows for the mobilisation of the Solidarity Fund within the annual ceiling of EUR 1 billion. Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic have requested the mobilisation of this fund in the wake of natural disasters which resulted in substantial material damage. Indeed, in these countries, a period of unusually heavy rainfall led to flooding and rivers breaking their banks, with severe consequences and damage to the people. The Commission's services found that all the applications meet the eligibility criteria set out in Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002.

Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic requested financial assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) after these countries were hit by extensive floods and torrential rain. This natural disaster resulted in serious damage to infrastructure, agriculture and private property. The direct damages have been estimated by the Slovenian, Czech and Croatian authorities at a total of EUR 19 546 647. In the case of Slovenia, the direct damages exceeded the normal threshold of 0.6 % of gross national income (GNI) for mobilising the EUSF, and can be considered a major natural disaster. In the cases of the Czech Republic and Croatia, the direct damages did not exceed the normal threshold, but a country affected by the same major natural disaster as a neighbouring country may exceptionally receive money from the EUSF.

We think it is a good idea that draft amending budgets may be presented in the case of unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances.

The mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) means it can be accessed for a maximum of EUR 1 billion per year for the purpose of repairing infrastructure. Therefore, since it is a tool of refinancing, it cannot be used to compensate private damages.
<P>
In the case of Slovenia, the direct damage exceeds the normal threshold of 0.6% of gross national income (GNI) for mobilising the EUSF and can qualify as a 'major natural disaster'. In the cases of the Czech Republic and Croatia, where direct damage does not exceed the normal threshold, the specific condition set out in Article 2(2) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002, whereby a country affected by the same major disaster as a neighbouring country may exceptionally benefit from EUSF, was found to be met. Due to its status as an acceding country to the EU, Croatia is therefore eligible to benefit from the EUSF.

Lastly, we think it is necessary to redeploy under-implemented appropriations from European Economic Recovery Plan, namely: to finance the needs for the mobilisation of EUSF, to draw upon the negative reserve and to reinforce payment appropriation for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.
<SPEAKER ID="300" NAME="Nuno Melo" LANGUAGE="PT">
The 2011 EU budget provided for a certain amount to be used in the European Union Solidarity Fund, which has already been used to assist various Member States that have been affected by natural disasters.

The rapporteur considers this redeployment inappropriate and proposes redeployment under implemented appropriation from 'European Economic Recovery Plan - Energy Networks' to finance the needs arising from the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund; to draw upon the negative reserve adopted in Amending budget No 1/2011; and to reinforce payment appropriation for the EGF.

The aim of the amending budget is to allow for the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in the case of immediate damage caused by the floods last year in Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Croatia.

However, the EU will provide the financial aid from another budget heading than that used for the Member States which have been affected. The objective of the fund is not to provide compensation for private damage, but to pay for the reconstruction of the infrastructure. It is a refinancing instrument and I have taken this into consideration when voting.
<SPEAKER ID="301" NAME="Alfredo Pallone" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of Mrs Jędrzejewska's report to allow the definitive appropriation of solidarity funds for the natural disasters that have taken place in Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic. The principle of solidarity towards those affected by disasters is an inviolable principle, but we need to come up with a good solution to locate the necessary funds. In this case, the draft amending budget is the instrument through which Parliament can give the green light to the appropriation of the funds. We were therefore able to find EUR 19.5 million, avoiding increasing Member States' contributions through issuing additional funds - which the Member States were against - but rather by taking them from energy projects whose execution is so delayed as to necessitate the redistribution of their appropriations.
<SPEAKER ID="301" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
According to the Financial Regulation, the Commission may present draft amending budgets 'if there are unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances'. Following Report, which detailed the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) for Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic, an amendment needs to be adopted for the Community budget. The eligibility conditions for assistance from the fund have been checked. The direct losses were calculated by the Slovenian, Czech and Croatian authorities to total EUR 19.5 million. In the case of Slovenia, the direct damages exceed the normal threshold of 0.6% of gross national income for the mobilisation of the EUSF, and the event can be considered a 'major natural disaster'. In the cases of the Czech Republic and Croatia, where the direct damages did not exceed the normal threshold, the specific condition whereby a country affected by the same major disaster as a neighbouring country may exceptionally benefit from the EUSF was found to be met. In view of this, I voted for this report, which will allow Slovenia, Croatia and the Czech Republic to address the serious material damages caused by natural disasters.

The Commission may present draft amending budgets in the case of unavoidable, exceptional or unforeseen circumstances. On 25 March, the Commission presented Draft Amending Budget No 2/2011 to the 2011 general budget, which aims to mobilise the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) in order to mitigate the effects of the intense rain in Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Croatia during the summer of 2010. The conditions of eligibility to the fund are detailed in Council Regulation No 2012/2002 establishing the EUSF. Furthermore, it must be noted that the objective of the fund is to repair infrastructure and that since it is a tool of refinancing, it cannot be used to compensate private damages. The direct damages have been estimated by the Slovenian, Czech and Croatian authorities at a total of EUR 19 546 647. In the case of Slovenia, the direct damages exceed the normal threshold for mobilising the EUSF and can qualify as a 'major natural disaster'. Meanwhile, in the cases of the Czech Republic and Croatia, direct damages do not exceed the normal threshold. I voted in favour of the proposal so that these countries can benefit from EU solidarity.
<SPEAKER ID="301" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
The Commission has proposed mobilising the European Union Solidarity Fund to help repair the infrastructure damaged by the flooding of September 2010, which hit Slovenia, and was deemed a 'major natural disaster'. Croatia and the Czech Republic, Slovenia's neighbouring countries, also subsequently suffered damage due to natural disasters. To this end a way of funding assistance needs to be found, and, according to the rapporteur, the European Economic Recovery Plan, in the area of energy, should finance the coverage needed for the mobilised funds.

The European Union has set up the appropriate legislative and budgetary instruments to provide additional support to workers who are suffering from the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns and to assist their reintegration into the labour market, and has established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF). Given the enormous impact of the global financial and economic crisis on European industry, in 2009, the scope of the EGF was broadened, in order to provide support for workers made redundant as a result of this crisis. In this instance, Denmark has requested assistance in respect of cases concerning 1650 redundancies (of which 825 are targeted for assistance) in the enterprise LM Glasfiber, which is involved in the manufacture of machinery and equipment in three municipalities located in the southern part ofDenmark (Syddanmark). As the application fulfils the criteria, I welcome the call to provide the required assistance to people made redundant as quickly and efficiently as possible.

The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was created in 2006 in order to provide additional assistance to workers affected by the consequences of significant changes in the structure of international trade, and to assist in their reintegration into the labour market. Since 1 May 2009, the remit of the EGF has been expanded to include support for workers made redundant as a direct consequence of the economic, financial and social crisis.
<P>
At a time when we are facing this severe crisis, one of the principal consequences of which is an increase in unemployment, the EU should use all of the means at its disposal to react, particularly with regard to providing support to those who find themselves without a job from one day to the next. I therefore voted for this report on the mobilisation of the EGF for Denmark, with the aim of supporting the 825 workers made redundant from the enterprise LM Glasfiber, a manufacturer of machinery and equipment.

In terms of mobilising the fund for the case in question, I voted in favour because it does not present critical issues and because the request meets the established eligibility criteria. Denmark has requested a mobilisation of EUR 6 247 415 in relation to 1 650 redundancies.

A total of 1 650 workers have been made redundant, of which 825 can receive assistance. Sectors and workers are continuing to lose work, increasing widespread concerns about the potential of European growth and the sustainability of its socio-economic model.

Given the effects of the global economic and financial crisis on the European wind market, causing a sudden reduction in EU demand in favour of Asia, the enterprise LM Glasfiber has closed units that were dedicated to manufacturing machinery and equipment in three municipalities located in the Region of Southern Denmark (Syddanmark), instead developing its business through partnerships in China. As a result, 1 650 workers were made redundant from LM Glasfiber at the start of 2010. Given the importance of retraining these manual workers for local and European production, I voted for the mobilisation of a total amount of EUR 6 247 415 from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for programmes supporting the reintegration of the redundant workers into the labour market.

Once again, we have voted for this mobilisation, but we would like to reiterate and stress that there should have been intervention before the closure occurred, in order to protect production and jobs.

We need a change of direction and policies in the EU, rather than mere palliatives. It has become increasingly urgent to implement the proposal that we made during the debate on the 2011 budget, in order to create a European programme for employment and sustainable development, to which 1% of EU gross domestic product would be allocated, with additional capital from the Member States. The aim of this would be real convergence, the promotion of each country's potential, the sustainable use of their resources, investment in production and the creation of jobs with rights.

In May 2011, the Commission adopted a new draft decision to mobilise the EGF to assist Denmark, in order to support the re-entry onto the labour market of workers made redundant due to the financial and economic crisis. This is the fourth request to be reviewed within the framework of the 2011 budget. It involves the mobilisation of a total sum of EUR 6 247 415 from the EGF to assist 1 650 workers - of whom the assistance applies to 825 - who were made redundant, within a four-month reference period between 1 January and 30 April 2010, from the Danish firm LM Glasfiber in southern Denmark (Syddanmark). The Commission's assessment is based on an evaluation of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial crisis, the unforeseeable nature of the redundancies and also evidence of the number of redundancies. In accordance with the Commission's assessment, the request fulfils the entitlement criteria set out in the Regulation on the EGF, and the Commission recommends that the budgetary authority should approve the request. I also consider it desirable to ensure a rapid procedure for adopting decisions on mobilising the fund, with due regard to the Interinstitutional Agreement.

The EU is an area of solidarity and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a part of this. This support is essential for helping the unemployed and those affected by the company relocations that occur within a globalised context. More and more companies are relocating, taking advantage of lower labour costs in a number of countries, particularly China and India, with a damaging effect on those countries that respect workers' rights. The EGF aims to help workers who are affected by the relocation of companies, and it is essential for facilitating access to new employment. The EGF has been used by other EU countries in the past, so now it is appropriate to grant this aid to Denmark, which has applied for assistance with regard to 1 650 cases of redundancy, of which 825 are targeted for assistance, at the enterprise LM Glasfiber operating in the NACE Revision 2 Division 28 (Manufacture of machinery and equipment) in three municipalities in the region of southern Denmark.

It cannot be considered acceptable to have a situation in which environmentally friendly technology is already largely imported from logistically distant Asia while Europeans remain unemployed. I hope that Germany's decision to make a transition to renewable energy, along with attempts by other Member States to increase the proportion of renewable energy, will provide a new stimulus for the entire European wind energy sector.

The enterprise LM Glasfiber, based in the region of Syddanmark in Denmark, has faced severe difficulties due to changes in the wind turbine market, the economic and financial crisis and the sudden reduction in EU demand in favour of Asia. In view of this, LM Glasfiber deemed it appropriate to reduce its production facilities in Lunderskov and Hammelev and to establish a strategic partnership with a Chinese company.

Firstly, why do we need to establish this new large-scale agency? There is plainly no other solution. It would be quite wrong to assign the entire responsibility to the Commission, especially in view of the protracted problems that have occurred in recent years regarding the development of the systems. Furthermore, the Commission itself has repeatedly pointed out that its running of Eurodac is merely a stopgap solution and that it does not consider itself equal to assuming direct management responsibility for large-scale IT systems. We therefore need to establish an agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, because an executive agency would not provide a solution. In that case the legislature would be denied the possibility to shape the agency and exercise its democratic scrutiny. Executive agencies are set up by the Commission entirely under its supervision and responsibility. The Commission lays down their tasks and appoints their managing bodies, including the director. An executive agency has a limited life and would thus be a temporary solution.
<SPEAKER ID="318" NAME="Philippe Boulland" LANGUAGE="FR">
I did not support the resolution on the Schengen area, because I think it is not appropriate to have a resolution that would refuse, on principle, any expansion of the criteria to enable controls to be set up at internal borders and that would therefore run counter to the conclusions of the European Council and the proposals of the Commission. If we restrict ourselves to the current criteria for 'public policy and public security', the Member States will continue to act unilaterally, interpreting these criteria broadly in the case of increased migratory pressures. If this happens, we run the risk of conflating immigration and insecurity when we need to respond to migratory pressures. By contrast, the proposed device aims to create a mechanism enabling controls to be reintroduced at borders only under exceptional circumstances, as a last resort and through a European mechanism. Now we need to strengthen the governance of the Schengen area. The aim of this initiative is precisely to enable us to provide responses to the crisis that the Schengen area is going through at the moment. This crisis is particularly associated with the fact that certain Member States are no longer able to ensure that they respect their obligations under the Schengen acquis when it comes to effectively controlling their sections of the external borders.

in writing. - SIS II claims to help ensure a high level of security within the area of freedom, security and justice of the EU, including maintaining public security and public policy. Parliament states that the VIS enables consulates to exchange visa information in order to facilitate the application procedure, helping to prevent 'visa shopping' and fraud, and facilitating checks at external borders to identify third-country nationals. However these controls should be strictly sovereign. I do not believe in the efficacy of the project, it is both expensive and will encompass IS II, VIS and Eurodac, meaning eventually all IT systems in the area of security and justice will merge, raising questions about increased vulnerability to computer hacking and the acquisition and storage of data. I believe this vote represents a step in that direction and thus should be blocked.

I am voting for this report as I believe that establishing this agency for the operational management of SIS II, the Visa Information System, Eurodac and other instruments that are being established in the area of freedom, security and justice, is undoubtedly the best option for the medium- and long-term functioning of the EU. I would also like to congratulate my colleague Mr Coelho on the excellent report that he has presented, the conclusions of which I agree with. The agency will function as a platform that will enable a more effective flow of information, and will therefore allow better results to be achieved.

This is clearly one of those cases. The nature of this establishment clearly justifies the emergence of such a body. As the rapporteur says, and I concur, there is a real need to ensure the operational management of the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System, and Eurodac and parts of the communication infrastructure after the transitional period and potentially of other large-scale information technology systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, subject to the adoption of separate legal instruments. This single management authority can help to improve coordination between systems, enhance European responsiveness to matters of high sensitivity, provide training for technicians and experts with a high level of knowledge about such matters and, last but not least, make better use of resources. Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he has done.

This report seeks to ensure the establishment of an agency for the operational management of large-scale information technology systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, such as the second-generation Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac for the comparison of fingerprints, as well as parts of the communication infrastructure. This agency has objectives and tasks that are, in theory, solely technical and related to operational management, and does not have the capacity to make policy decisions, for example, on setting up new systems or on the possibility of interoperability between the different systems. This proposal, on which I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and also congratulate him for having been able to reach an agreement at the first reading, reinforces the rules on data protection and the integrity and security of personal data, as well as the role of Parliament in its democratic control.

Our fundamental disagreements with the approach taken by the EU in the areas that are the subject of this report are well known. We believe that the need to preserve rights, freedoms and guarantees, which are vital to the real democratic functioning of the Member States, is not taken sufficiently into account.

in writing. - (SK) In June 2009, the Commission presented two legislative initiatives on the establishment of an agency for the management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice. The first initiative comprised a draft regulation on first pillar issues relating to the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac, while the second initiative comprised a draft decision on third pillar issues relating to these systems. With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, however, these initiatives lost their justification. This is because, although the distinction between the three pillars was removed, the proposal in question possesses a variable geometry relating to various aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice in general, and specifically to aspects of the Schengen area. The legal framework of the systems to be administered by the agency applies to a diverse group of Member States with varying levels of participation, in the case of the United Kingdom, Denmark and Ireland, and associated third countries such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and, in future, Liechtenstein. The Commission has drawn up an impact assessment in order to determine what would be the best solution from a financial, operational and institutional perspective. The most appropriate solution appears to be to establish a European agency, although it should be emphasised that the aims and tasks of the agency relate exclusively to the technical level of operational management. The agency should not have the power to take political decisions, for example it should not be allowed to set up new systems or take decisions relating to the interaction of systems.

As a Member of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I voted in favour of this report on the creation of an 'Agency for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice', which will make it possible to improve the management of data collected through the three large-scale IT systems used by the European Union: European Dactyloscopy (Eurodac), the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS). This legislative package will allow us to accommodate these three data systems within a single platform in order to enable better continuity in data management, improved exchanges of data and an increased number of synergies. In addition, it will enable us to improve and enhance the European Union's capacities in relation to judicial and police cooperation. I therefore voted in favour of creating such an agency, which is eventually intended to become a centre of excellence in IT systems management. In addition to that, I want to lay emphasis on the essential principles concerning the protection of personal data, which this agency, and the way it functions, will have to respect strictly.

It would also be quite wrong to assign the responsibility to the Commission, especially in view of the protracted problems that have occurred in recent years regarding the development of the systems.

In fact, the agency will not have the power to take political decisions concerning, for example, the creation of new systems and interoperability between the various systems. We therefore believe it is necessary to establish rules to prevent the agency's responsibilities being widened de facto through a proliferation of pilot projects beyond the range of supervision and transparency.

The agency will therefore be responsible for the supervision and the security of communication infrastructures and will guarantee a comprehensive network for the exchange of information. It will therefore be essential to protect the network from any threat as well as to guarantee the security of personal data. The legal framework of the various systems that will be managed by this agency applies to a diverse collection of Member States with varying levels of participation, as well as to an assortment of associated third countries.

The establishment of a European agency, which will ensure the management of the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System, a database containing the fingerprints of asylum seekers (Eurodac), and other systems in the Schengen acquis, was adopted today by Parliament. The agency, based in Tallinn, Estonia, is due to begin its work in the summer of 2012.

There is no clear and understandable provision for the control and interaction of all three systems. The budget has been already adopted and there are no grounds for spending the funds that this proposal requires. There is a lack of transparency and targets and there is no plan of work.

In theory, the new IT agency will link together the visa databases and the digital information on asylum seekers and criminals more effectively than has been done in the past. When we consider the fact that the Schengen Information System (SIS) was originally designed to handle 15 million records and the requirements have now increased to 100 million, not least because of national differences, the scope of this IT project becomes clear. If the data cannot be coordinated within one system without problems, in other words, SIS or SIS II, which must also make the data available to Eurojust and Europol, we need to ask critical questions about whether our own IT agency will be able to link together all the disparate systems. In the light of the proliferation of EU agencies and the existing options available for coordinating IT systems, we need to consider whether introducing our own IT agency will not simply inflate the EU budget unnecessarily without actually bringing greater security. I have abstained from voting because of my doubts on this matter.

The new agency will be an umbrella agency that will manage the technical aspects of the SIS II, VIS and Eurodac systems. Its priority will be to protect the network and the data exchanged within it.

In June 2009, the Commission submitted a pair of legislative initiatives with a view to establishing an agency to manage large-scale information technology systems within the area of freedom, security, and justice. This was a proposal for a regulation on first-pillar matters related to the Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System, and Eurodac, and a proposal for a decision on third-pillar matters related to those systems. However, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the initiatives were rendered obsolete. On 19 March 2010, the Commission submitted a new proposal amounting essentially to a revised version of the earlier proposal for a regulation in view of Lisbon, incorporating the third-pillar matters. I welcome the work carried out by my colleague Mr Coelho, as several articles attempt to strengthen Parliament's role and ensure greater transparency.

The establishment of an agency for the operational management of large-scale information technology systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, with a view to the management of the second-generation Schengen Information System, the Visa Information System and Eurodac, is aimed at optimising available resources and seeking to achieve economies of scale. Given that this is such a sensitive matter, it should be ensured that the agency is provided with the financial means necessary for its activities, which largely provide the desired autonomy, and that the Member States are linked to its functioning, by acting in a supervisory role. Parliament's monitoring role must also be ensured, especially because of the particularly sensitive aspects dealt with in these areas, such as the need to protect the personal data of citizens.

In accordance with the rapporteur's position, the agency's objectives and tasks are connected solely with the technical level of operational management. The agency must not have the power to take political decisions, for example with regard to setting up new systems or systems interoperability. My Estonian colleagues and I are very glad that Estonia and France were today able to reach the agreement that was also confirmed today, namely that the new agency will be located in Tallinn, Estonia. Since the technical development of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the Visa Information System (VIS), as well as the preparation for their operational management, had already been carried out in Strasbourg, and a backup site for these IT systems had already been established in Sankt Johann im Pongau in Austria, Estonia, France and Austria came to an agreement that they would remain there. I think that the creation of this agency will increase the reliability of the European Union's IT systems and will lead to the speedier and more effective creation of new systems. There are now several examples of how the development of trans-European systems has been delayed and their quality has not been ideal, and therefore the creation of the new agency is altogether justified.

It will, moreover, have to respect the conditions and procedures of data exchange among the countries of the European Union and to play the role of 'facilitator'. It is necessary to create such an agency because it will enable the centralisation of all these data in a single database and thus facilitate cooperation between the judicial and police authorities of the Member States.

In addition to these operational tasks, the agency, which should work 24 hours per day and seven days per week, also has the power to adopt security measures, draft reports and promote training, as well as to issue and monitor information.

<SPEAKER ID="331" NAME="Luís Paulo Alves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I am voting for this report as the exemption from or a reduction in customs duties for certain products manufactured in the French overseas departments meets the specific measures required to make up for the insularity, energy dependence, small market size and low level of exports that characterise these regions.
<SPEAKER ID="331" NAME="Sophie Auconie" LANGUAGE="FR">
The ultra-peripheral regions (UPRs) of the European Union - Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana and Réunion - suffer from specific handicaps. For example, they are remote, they depend on other countries for raw materials and energy, they have to build up more significant stocks, their local markets are weak, and their export activity is underdeveloped. This justifies specific aid measures. Dock dues, a French tax applied to imports in these overseas regions, favour a certain amount of rebalancing of the markets between local and imported products, and are therefore very much needed. I voted in favour of this report because it enables these rules to be adapted to the specific case of French Guiana, as requested by the French authorities and the European Commission.
<SPEAKER ID="332" NAME="Izaskun Bilbao Barandica" LANGUAGE="ES">
I voted for this initiative as French Guiana, being an outermost region, finds itself in economic and social difficulties, due to its insular nature, which are detrimental to its regional development. France, through dock dues, can establish differentiated taxation for some products that are made in those places. Extending by 50 products the list of those to which differentiated taxation may be applied in French Guiana will enable the promotion or maintenance of local activities and investments in local development and employment.

I agree with the reasons that led the French authorities to ask for a separate system together with partial or total exemption from dock dues, depending on the product. These territories are what are known as outermost regions, where social and geographical difficulties are combined with economic production that is usually concentrated in certain market areas.
<P>
I therefore agree with granting a special system of dock dues, since in cases like these it is fair to resort to such means to ensure the economic and social stability of these regions.
<SPEAKER ID="333" NAME="Sebastian Valentin Bodu" LANGUAGE="RO">
The dock dues system, approved by the European Parliament on 5 July 2011, authorises France, until 1 July 2014, to apply differential rates for dock dues to certain products manufactured in its four overseas departments (ODs). Dock dues are crucial for supporting outermost regions economically and socially disadvantaged by certain permanent factors, such as their small area and insularity, remoteness from major markets, inadequate topography and climate or dependence on a small number of products available on the market. Dock dues are intended to bring stability to the economies of outermost regions, helping them to maintain jobs in areas where the unemployment rate is close to 30% and, by extension, support local production. Furthermore, the revenue obtained from levying these dock dues, which makes up between 37% and 48% of local authority budgets in the overseas departments, is intended and must continue to underpin the policies promoting investment in local development. Consequently, the European Parliament supports the necessary step of making permanent, as of 2014, the exemptions from or reductions in dock dues granted in the case of the French ODs.
<SPEAKER ID="333" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
Given the added difficulties of outermost regions, which are strongly affected by insularity, remoteness from major markets, difficult topography and climate, small size and heavy economic dependence on a small number of products and activities, I support this initiative, which allows differential rates of tax known as 'dock dues' to be applied to certain products manufactured in France's four overseas departments. Additional stimuli are essential to the economic stability and promotion of employment in these regions, where the rate of employment is close to 30% and the revenue from the 'dock dues' makes up between 37% and 48% of local authority budgets. I therefore support the extension of these measures beyond 2014.
<SPEAKER ID="333" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
We voted for this report, given the importance of adopting specific measures for the outermost regions and bearing in mind their economic and social situation, and the fact that they are permanently disadvantaged, which hinders their development and fully justifies these types of measures.

We support the rapporteur in advocating that the Commission propose ways of putting the measure on a permanent footing from 2014 onwards, so that the outermost regions in question do not find themselves subject to economic uncertainty at 10-yearly intervals. These systems are extremely important in protecting the outermost regions, in view of their unique characteristics. The same type of measures should be implemented not only in the outermost regions but in all the Member States, especially those with weaker and more vulnerable economies, such as Portugal, in order to enhance and protect their production and employment.

The fact that these regions are permanently disadvantaged by their insularity, remoteness from major markets, small size, difficult topography and climate, and their economic dependence on a small number of products, severely hinders their development and fully justifies the implementation of the approved measures.. A system has been established for this purpose, which, until 1 July 2014, will allow France to employ the variable taxation system known as dock dues in its four overseas departments for certain products produced in these overseas departments. This system is of fundamental importance for the economic stability of these highly remote regions, making it possible to retain local production and jobs. At the same time, the dock dues revenues allocated to the regions play an important role in supporting investment policies aimed at local development. In my opinion, it is therefore necessary to retain the dock dues tax exemption or reduction granted to the French overseas departments, and, at the same time, I believe it would be right to consider retaining these measures permanently in order to avoid creating a situation of economic uncertainty in these highly remote regions every 10 years.

The fact that these regions are permanently disadvantaged by their insularity, remoteness from major markets, small size, difficult topography and climate, and their economic dependence on a small number of products, severely hinders their development and fully justifies the implementation of the approved measures. The Commission proposal, accompanied by a proposal for a Council decision, suggests, in the case of French Guiana, extending the list of products to which differentiated tax arrangements for dock dues may be applied by some 50 products. The European Parliament also supports the necessary step of making permanent, as of 2014, the exemptions from or reductions in dock dues granted in the case of the French overseas departments.

We believe, in fact, that the 'dock dues' system is important for economic stability in the outermost regions, since it enables local production and employment to be maintained and provides valuable support for policies promoting investment in local development. We therefore endorse putting the measure on a permanent footing so that the outermost regions in question do not find themselves subject to economic uncertainty at 10-yearly intervals.

We therefore call for the exemptions from or reductions in 'dock dues' granted in the case of the French overseas departments to be maintained beyond 2014.
<SPEAKER ID="338" NAME="Jean-Luc Mélenchon" LANGUAGE="FR">
Dock dues are relevant in more than one way. They favour local production over imports. They therefore favour short transport routes over long ones. They protect local jobs and allocate the necessary resources to territorial authorities. As Mr Hoarau quite rightly mentions, dock dues must be made permanent in order to ensure stable revenues for local authorities.

EU treaties authorise the Council, on a proposal from the Commission and after consulting Parliament, to adopt specific measures for the benefit of the Union's outermost regions, taking account of their social and economic situation. The fact that these regions are permanently disadvantaged by their insularity, remoteness from major markets, small size, difficult topography and climate and their economic dependence on a small number of products severely hinders their development and fully justifies the implementation of specially tailored measures. This type of exemption makes complete sense in order to help these regions to better address their economic challenges. However, we believe that it is important that this type of exemption is made permanent, rather than having to be re-evaluated every 10 years, leaving the outermost regions in a situation of real economic uncertainty.

in writing. - The purpose of the proposed Council Decision is to authorise France to apply exemptions from or reductions in the tax known as 'dock dues' to certain products manufactured in the French Overseas Departments (DOMs). The annex to the decision contains a list of products to which tax exemptions and reductions may be applied. The reasons for adopting specific measures include isolation, raw material and energy dependence, the obligation to build up stocks, the small size of local markets and the low level of export activity. The measures are thus designed to strengthen local industry by making it more competitive - but why should this apply specifically in France? Could it be because that country has a dominant position in the EU and here in Parliament? I think it makes sense to consider such alleviating measures for all EU Member States. I abstained.
<SPEAKER ID="338" NAME="Rolandas Paksas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) Having properly evaluated the economic and social situation of the outermost regions, specific measures must be applied. It should be noted that permanent disadvantages such as the regions' remoteness and isolation increase production costs and the cost price of goods produced, and consequently the goods are not competitive. All of this severely hinders the regions' industry and development. Reductions in dock dues or exemption from them is one of the measures that promotes and sustains local economic activity and employment, and contributes to economic stability. Consequently, I believe that, in the case of French Guiana, it is advisable to extend the list of products to which differentiated tax arrangements for dock dues may be applied. This will help maintain local production of most goods, enabling such goods to remain on the market. Furthermore, the revenue from the dock dues underpins policies promoting investment in local development.

The fact that these regions are permanently disadvantaged by their insularity, a situation all too familiar to the Portuguese residents of the Azores and Madeira, remoteness from major markets, small size, difficult topography and climate and their economic dependence on a small number of products severely hinders their development and fully justifies the implementation of specially tailored measures. Such is the basis for France's so-called 'dock dues' system, which has been found to be broadly positive in view of its goals, especially in terms of its positive impact on preserving employment. The Commission proposal, accompanied by a proposal for a Council decision, suggests, in the case of French Guiana, extending the application of this system to some 50 products. Parliament approves this proposal without amendment. In view of the particular characteristics of the economies of the outermost regions and bearing in mind that the 'dock dues' comply with Community law and stimulate these economies, I voted in favour of this report.

The dock dues system is crucially important to the economic stability of the outermost regions concerned. For one thing, it enables local production and employment to be maintained. For another, the revenue from the dock dues makes up almost half of local authority budgets in the overseas departments and is intended, and must continue, to underpin policies promoting investment in local development. I have voted in favour so that these regions can continue to develop further.
<SPEAKER ID="338" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
The 'dock dues' system aims to support the outermost regions, resulting in a system that applies differential rates of tax to certain products manufactured in the French overseas departments. This system supports regions where these types of measures can really drive the local economy, where there are often high rates of unemployment. As the rapporteur suggests, it is also important to consider putting these measures, which are currently uncertain, on a permanent footing as support mechanisms for regions with problems of this nature.

<SPEAKER ID="340" NAME="Nikolaos Salavrakos" LANGUAGE="EL">
I voted in favour of the Hoarau report, because I consider that dock dues are vital to the stability of the economies of the outermost areas in question. On the one hand, they help to maintain local production and employment in areas in which unemployment is close to 30% and, on the other hand, the revenue from them, which goes to the regions and accounts for between 37% and 48% of local community budgets in overseas departments, is designed to provide important support for investment policies for local growth and must retain that aspect.
<SPEAKER ID="341" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
The special circumstances of the outermost regions requires the adoption of specific measures, which take due account of their economic and social situation. The constraints and permanent difficulties that such regions face, such as their insularity, remoteness from markets and small size severely hinders their development and justifies measures that can help to reduce the impact of current constraints.
<P>
Indeed, this possibility is included in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union itself, which deals with the special status of the outermost regions in Article 349. Such is the basis for the decision on 'dock dues' measures, under which France is authorised, until 1 July 2014, to apply differential rates of the tax known as 'dock dues' to certain products manufactured in its four overseas departments. I believe that special attention should be given to the needs and difficulties of the outermost regions, provided this applies to the adoption of specific and appropriate measures for all the outermost regions of the EU that contribute to promoting employment there and in other outermost regions, and better integrating them into the European Union's internal market. I therefore voted for the document in plenary.
<SPEAKER ID="341" NAME="Marie-Christine Vergiat" LANGUAGE="FR">
I would like to congratulate my colleague Mr Hoarau, the MEP from the Communist Party of Réunion, for his report on products that could benefit from an exemption from or a reduction in dock dues, which was adopted by the European Parliament by a very large majority: 652 votes in favour, 15 votes against and 4 abstentions.
<P>
This report recognises the particular difficulties faced by the ultra-peripheral regions: insularity, distance from large markets, superficial weakness and economic dependence with regard to a small number of products.
<P>
Parliament is drawing the consequences from this particular situation and is authorising France to provide, up to 1 July 2014, tax exemptions from dock dues for the four overseas French departments for certain products manufactured in those departments.
<P>
The report goes further, though, calling on the Commission to consider extending these exemptions beyond 2014 so that dock dues will continue to favour the competitiveness of local products, jobs and policies for investment in the overseas departments

in writing. - (DE) Taking into consideration the social and economic situation of the European Union's outermost regions, the measures implemented by the EU to provide them with support have so far been highly successful, including the exemption from or reduction in dock dues. A French interim report confirms the positive impact of these measures, which includes maintaining local businesses and, therefore, preserving jobs. For this reason, I have voted in favour of extending the exemption to a further list of products.
<SPEAKER ID="343" NAME="Luís Paulo Alves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I am voting for this report, which is the result of complex negotiation among all the political groups, as it emphasises the importance of the universal obligations on social inclusion and calls upon the Commission to provide guidelines on the best way to adopt the revised Universal Service Directive. I would also like to stress the importance given to broadband access for everyone and the creation of the common European emergency number 112.
<SPEAKER ID="343" NAME="Laima Liucija Andrikien" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - I voted in favour of the resolution on universal service and the 112 emergency number. We MEPs believe that the European emergency number 112 can be a lifesaving number and that it should be smoothly operational throughout the Union. We urge the Commission to ensure that every section of society has access to this service, including people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. To that end, it is important that the Commission and Member States improve the accuracy and reliability of caller location information under the new EU telecoms rules and upgrade the relevant technology with the ultimate goal of mandatory automatic location for all 112 calls. I support the rapporteur's view that it would be a great achievement to establish a 'reverse 112 system', i.e. an EU-wide, universal, multilingual, accessible, simplified and efficient interconnected system of warning and alerting citizens in the event of imminent or developing natural and/or man-made major emergencies and disasters of any type.
<SPEAKER ID="345" NAME="Elena Oana Antonescu" LANGUAGE="RO">
Numerous recent disasters have shown that alerting citizens and giving them early warning in the event of imminent major emergencies and disasters is necessary if material losses and the loss of human life are to be reduced. However, a large majority of Europeans are still unaware that the 112 emergency services number exists, even though it was introduced in 1991 to enable citizens to access emergency services such as fire, police and ambulance services, with it being the only emergency service number that can be called in every Member State in the European Union. This is why I encourage Member States to step up their joint efforts to inform the public about the existence of the 112 number and its use, especially by developing a specific, comprehensive communications strategy which deals with citizens' concerns and questions about how the system works. I voted in favour of this report.
<SPEAKER ID="343" NAME="Sophie Auconie" LANGUAGE="FR">
I supported this own-initiative report, which aims to assess recent changes in relation to the concept of basic universal services enshrined in the Universal Services and Users' Rights Directive. It examines the possibility of extending universal access to broadband and stresses the need for coordinated approaches and adequate financing, taking account of the specific needs of vulnerable people and disabled consumers. This report also focuses on the single European emergency number 112, particularly on the visibility of this number and on citizens' awareness of it. It lays the emphasis on improving the efficiency of emergency lines in order to protect public health and ensure civil protection, to promote improvement in how calls are dealt with and to assess the quality of the assistance provided, from the time when the call is made to the time when action is taken.
<SPEAKER ID="344" NAME="Liam Aylward" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
in writing. - (GA) It is a fundamental right of everyone in the EU to have basic access to telecommunications infrastructure. Everyone in the Union must be able to enjoy the advantages of the digital era. Where there is no financial incentive for the private sector to implement the appropriate infrastructure, the Universal Services Directive ensures that the state will assume responsibility for making a basic service available to everyone. I fully support the 'Broadband for all' aim of the Digital Agenda and agree with the report's contents in relation to providing sufficient funds in order to achieve this. The 112 number is a service with significant rescue potential, but it is manifestly not familiar enough in the EU. If the people of the EU are not well aware of, and used to, this number, it is of little use. Everyone in the EU must have access to this number. A comprehensive review must be set up to improve the service and ensure that the European people have the information and the ability to use the 112 number in case of emergency.
<SPEAKER ID="344" NAME="Zigmantas Balčytis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this report. The introduction of the European 112 emergency number was aimed at increasing the protection of EU citizens and providing them with urgent assistance, using the same number in all EU Member States and ensuring the smooth functioning of the 112 emergency number throughout the European Union. However, the European 112 emergency number has not yet reached its full potential. A Eurobarometer survey published in 2011 reveals that barely 26% of EU citizens know that the 112 number can be used to call for emergency services, while 58% of citizens believe there is a lack of information about the existence of the emergency number. I welcome the call for the Commission and the Member States to further step up their information work so that the emergency number 112 reaches all EU citizens and travellers through the media, particularly the print and audiovisual media. During information campaigns, special attention should be paid to practical information, such as stressing that 112 is the European emergency number, reachable from fixed and mobile phones free of charge everywhere in the EU.
<SPEAKER ID="345" NAME="Regina Bastos" LANGUAGE="PT">
The concept of universal service was developed by the European institutions and defines a set of requirements of general benefit to be met by certain activities. The obligations set out are aimed at ensuring everyone has universal access to certain essential services of quality and at an accessible cost.
<P>
This report, for which I voted, is aimed at assessing recent developments related to the basic concept of universal service, as enshrined in the Universal Service Directive in the context of universal access to broadband. The report also focuses on the single European emergency number 112, created in 1991 in the context of the single market and the free movement of people, with the aim of enabling access to emergency services using one and the same number throughout the whole of the EU.
<P>
It is therefore important to make the emergency number 112 known, and improve the effectiveness of hotlines in order to safeguard public health and ensure effective civil protection. The Commission's decision to carry out a detailed study of the provision of internet services is equally important.
<SPEAKER ID="346" NAME="Mara Bizzotto" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the own-initiative report by Mrs Rapti because I believe she has produced a critical and constructive assessment of the recent developments in universal service (or the minimum set of services of specified quality to which all end-users have access at an affordable price, including universal broadband access) and the European emergency number 112.
<P>
For example, the report emphasises that making broadband availability obligatory will not automatically result in higher take-up, and therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to reinforce measures to drive demand and stimulate take-up.
<P>
Moreover, I have to agree with the initiative to call on the Commission and the Member States to further step up their information work so that the emergency number 112 reaches all EU citizens and travellers through the media, particularly the print and audiovisual media, by means of information campaigns promoting it as the EU-wide emergency number,
<SPEAKER ID="346" NAME="Vilija Blinkevičiūt" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because the 112 emergency number must receive the support it needs to become the best means of protecting citizens' lives. The European Parliament has repeatedly stressed the need to raise awareness of the 112 emergency number and the fact that hitherto a poor quality of service has been provided to citizens through the 112 number. The latest edition of the Consumer Markets Scoreboard shows that, at EU level, the telecommunications market is one of the sectors with the lowest scores. Above all, the telecommunications market is one of the markets in which consumers found it most difficult to compare offers and experienced most problems. It also received the highest number of complaints. Internet access services also show a much greater price divergence across the EU. Internet service provision is actually the third worst ranking market in general and the market where the highest percentage of consumers have experienced problems, and where prices diverge widely across the EU. I therefore welcome the European Parliament's proposal for the Commission to carry out an in-depth study on internet service provision following the publication of the 4th Consumer Markets Scoreboard.
<SPEAKER ID="347" NAME="Sebastian Valentin Bodu" LANGUAGE="RO">
Twenty years have elapsed since the launch of the famous single European 112 emergency services number, an initiative whose existence has perhaps saved millions of lives. Although it has proved to be useful, the 112 number still has some further progress to make to be really effective. No matter how good an idea is, it must be adapted to the social context it is developing in and be revamped according to the real needs of the citizens it is serving. At the same time, an idea needs to receive the support it deserves for it to work. Both statements are valid in the case of the single 112 emergency number. I know countless people who have called this number when they have been in trouble. Fortunately, in the majority of situations that they can recall, they received the assistance they were expecting. The European Parliament, just like other stakeholders, has repeatedly stressed the need to raise the public's awareness of the 112 number and the poor quality of the services which have been provided so far to citizens via this number. I also share the sentiments of those stating that, like any good idea, this service needs to receive support so that it can deliver the maximum benefits to those pinning their hopes on it.
<SPEAKER ID="347" NAME="Cristian Silviu Buşoi" LANGUAGE="RO">
I fully endorse this report as it contains particularly important recommendations relating both to universal service and the single European 112 emergency number.
<P>
The proper implementation of the 112 emergency number can save many lives. We already emphasised this aspect even when we discussed the Telecom package years ago.
<P>
I think that it is absolutely essential for European citizens to be properly informed that this number exists so that they know which number they need to ring in an emergency when they are travelling in another Member State. Furthermore, I am pleased that this report urges Member States to improve the caller location facility as soon as possible to a few seconds after the call has been made. This aspect is of paramount importance as the speed of location determines the effectiveness of the intervention made by the emergency services. This aspect is technically feasible. Therefore, Member States and telecom operators must be willing to do it.
<P>
I think that investments need to be made in future-generation technologies to improve the 112 number by creating new applications which will enable data to be transferred by the emergency service so that it has as much information as possible available in real time prior to intervention.
<SPEAKER ID="347" NAME="Maria Da Graça Carvalho" LANGUAGE="PT">
I voted in favour because I believe that universal service obligations are important as a safety net for social inclusion. I support the Digital Agenda's 'broadband for all' objectives and am convinced that universal access to broadband helps citizens and businesses to reap the full benefits of the Digital Single Market, in particular by improving social inclusion. I believe that the European emergency number 112 can save lives and increase EU citizens' protection, and that the Commission should ensure that every segment of society has access to this service, including people with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.
<SPEAKER ID="348" NAME="Antonio Cancian" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the report on universal service and the 112 emergency number because I believe it will have a major impact on various aspects of people's lives.
<P>
In particular, the report provides a wide-ranging assessment of the developments in universal service, which first and foremost includes the European emergency number 112. I believe it is extremely important to have a single emergency number that people can call in any country in the Union, especially since summer is approaching, a time when many Europeans visit other countries as tourists and on holiday.
<P>
Moreover, the Rapti report examines developments in various other sectors connected with public health and services for citizens. Among these I would like to highlight easier broadband access that takes account of the requirements of more vulnerable people and those with disabilities, by helping them in terms of service provision, equipment and affordable charges.
<SPEAKER ID="349" NAME="Nessa Childers" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - The 112 number is a strategic and life-saving resource, and the EU needs to do more to promote this initiative.
<SPEAKER ID="349" NAME="Carlos Coelho" LANGUAGE="PT">
Universal service should provide all citizens, even in the remotest and outermost areas, with access to services essential for their participation in society, at affordable prices and without distorting competition. This will meet the objectives of the Digital Agenda, which aim to bring basic broadband coverage to all Europeans by 2013, allowing them to reap the full benefits of the single digital market.
<P>
The creation of the European emergency number 112, in 1991, was of the utmost importance, as it enables citizens to access emergency services using a single number, regardless of the Member State that they are in. Unfortunately, the vast majority of Europeans are still unaware of it, on top of the poor quality of the service that has thus far been provided to citizens through the 112 number, with no significant progress observed since 2000. In view of the fact that several recent disasters have shown that giving the public early warning in the event of emergencies or imminent or developing major disasters is necessary if suffering and the loss of life are to be reduced, it is vital that the quality of implementing this support service in cases of emergency be improved, especially in terms of information, accessibility, interoperability and intervention times.
<SPEAKER ID="349" NAME="Corina Creţu" LANGUAGE="RO">
According to a survey carried out in February 2011, only 26% of EU citizens can identify spontaneously the 112 number as the number to call for emergency services, while 58% of EU citizens still believe that the public has not been informed about the existence of this number. As a result, access must be improved via new electronic communications technologies or broadband services, including for people with disabilities, the elderly and vulnerable groups. It is also necessary to handle emergency calls in foreign languages more effectively, against the background of EU citizens' increased mobility.
<SPEAKER ID="349" NAME="Rachida Dati" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (FR) I voted in favour of this report, which shows a Europe serving its citizens, especially those who have the least. The report by my fellow Member Mrs Rapti makes useful recommendations for improving universal services and the use of the European emergency number 112. I was particularly happy to see in it a request to the European Commission to grant increased financial support to local projects and to communities who are working to facilitate access to digital services, and in particular, free access to the Internet for the most disadvantaged people. Here is a concrete way in which Europe can work for the social integration of all. With respect to 112, this report brings to light the low awareness of this number among European citizens. Only 26% say that they can spontaneously identify it as the European emergency number. The European Commission and the Member States both need to make significant efforts to achieve the desirable objective of 80% spontaneous identification contained in this report.

I voted for the report on the universal service and the emergency number 112, as it provides for the development of a communication strategy aimed at increasing public awareness of the existence and use of the 112 number, along with measures to improve the accessibility, quality and efficiency of this service.
<SPEAKER ID="350" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
In a society like the West, where there is a proliferation of media and means of communication, and in which the technology associated with them is evolving at a great speed, it is clear that the lack of opportunities in some sectors of the population to use such means, and thus come into contact with others and the information that they provide, is a factor of social exclusion. The establishment of European targets for network coverage, especially broadband, requires coordination between the Union and the Member States, and between the latter and the operators, so as to achieve the desired universal coverage. I was unaware that the European emergency number was not adequately known, since in my country knowledge of it is quite widespread, and I hope that this situation will be reversed, in order to allow more people to have access to it and to the rescue and emergency services that it has available.
<SPEAKER ID="350" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (PT) The European emergency number, 112, was created in 1991 to complement national emergency numbers and make emergency services more accessible for all the EU Member States. However, according to a Eurobarometer survey, currently only 26% of EU citizens can spontaneously identify 112 as the number to call for the police, the fire brigade or the ambulance service in any part of the EU. I understand that this percentage should be at 80% by 2020. This service can save lives, and its universal reach is of the utmost importance for protecting the public, particularly in the context of free movement within the EU. In order to ensure the greatest possible efficiency and a better service for those in need, and to combat fake calls for help, I support the georeferencing of calls, forcing both mobile and fixed telecoms operators to automatically ensure the identification and exact location of the people making the calls. It is also important to promote an inclusive service, ensuring the technical conditions necessary to provide an adequate response to people with disabilities, including with hearing and speech impairments, as well as to citizens of all nationalities, and to cater for all foreign languages.
<SPEAKER ID="350" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report evaluates the provision of the European emergency number 112, and analyses developments in relation to universal access to broadband. It advocates the Digital Agenda's 'broadband for all' objectives, taking the view that universal access to broadband will improve social inclusion, create new opportunities for businesses and stimulate employment. The report is also in favour of the emergency number 112. We believe that universal service is important, including the European emergency number 112, which, moreover, has already merited initiatives from us in Parliament. For this to be more efficient, it needs to be more widespread and of better quality. According to the report itself, only 26% of the population is aware of this emergency number.
<P>
On the matter of information technology, we would like to call attention to the approximately 100 million people in the EU who are at risk of poverty. One does not need to be reminded of the obvious difficulties that these people will have in accessing the new technologies. Concrete measures and action are therefore necessary so as to enable access for everyone, regardless of circumstance, to the emergency number, broadband and all new information technologies.
<SPEAKER ID="350" NAME="Carlo Fidanza" LANGUAGE="IT">
I welcome Mrs Rapti's report, which aims at improving accessibility to the European emergency number 112. In a European Union in which people are travelling more and more for work or pleasure, millions of people might find themselves facing an emergency, and having a single, EU-wide number is certainly a great help. Among the aspects that the report seeks to emphasise, two that I consider very important are the coordination of approaches and the financing of universal service, bearing in mind the specific requirements of vulnerable people and consumers with disabilities. Furthermore, the 112 number does not replace the national emergency numbers, but offers a parallel service.

We believe that universal service is important, such as the European emergency number 112. However, for this to be more efficient, it needs to be more widespread and of better quality, which requires special measures, as only 26% of the population is aware of this emergency number.
<P>
However, as we noted in the debate in plenary, this must not serve to increase social exclusion, as there are about 100 million people at risk of poverty, with poor access to new technology.
<P>
Concrete measures and action need to be considered so as to enable access for everyone, regardless of circumstance, to the emergency number, broadband and all new information technologies.

in writing. - (SK) The report assesses recent developments in relation to the conception of a universal service enshrined in the directive, and in the context of new developments in the area of universal access to broadband, coordinating approaches and financing them, taking into account the specific needs of vulnerable people and disabled consumers. The report also focuses on the emergency number 112, which was introduced to allow citizens to contact the emergency services by using a single number. The EU rules place an obligation on the state to ensure that citizens are able to connect to a public telephone landline network, and to have access to public telephone services with functioning Internet access. All States must ensure that consumers have access to information services, registers and public telephones, as well as specific measures for the disabled. The single European emergency number 112 was introduced in 1991 in connection with a directive of the EU Council of Ministers, and attention is also given to it in the Universal Service Directive. The need to raise awareness of the 112 number has been emphasised repeatedly, and the poor quality of the services provided to citizens so far through the 112 number has been pointed out. In my opinion, we should provide more support for the 112 number in order to give citizens the greatest possible benefit, because if we do not, the number will lose its justification.
<SPEAKER ID="351" NAME="Lorenzo Fontana" LANGUAGE="IT">
Mrs Rapti's report on the development of the universal service also takes into account the specific requirements of vulnerable people and consumers with disabilities. Given the importance of the subject and the sensitivity with which it has been treated, I confirm my vote in favour.
<SPEAKER ID="352" NAME="Pat the Cope Gallagher" LANGUAGE="GA">
More must be done at EU level to promote the '112' emergency telephone number. According to a survey recently conducted by Eurobarometer, only 26% of people in the EU understand that '112' is the number to call in an emergency. That number is extremely useful and important for individuals and families while on holiday in Europe during the summer.
<SPEAKER ID="352" NAME="Elisabetta Gardini" LANGUAGE="IT">
How many Europeans know that '112' is the European emergency number that they can call without charge from either landlines or mobiles anywhere in the Union?
<P>
According to a very recent Eurobarometer survey, only 26% do, while 58% believe people in their country are inadequately informed about it. With today's vote, Parliament urges the Commission to enhance the service offered by the '112' number so as to ensure that it operates smoothly in all the Member States. It is essential that this number should be really easy to access, even by the most vulnerable groups, particularly those with hearing difficulties, speech impediments or other disabilities.
<P>
The Member States, too, should undertake information and communication campaigns, targeting the most appropriate places for promoting awareness, such as schools, universities, pharmacies, outpatients' departments, stations, airports, etc. In addition, establishing 11 February every year as 'European 112 Day' can help promote this emergency number, which will be a real life saver once it is widely adopted.
<SPEAKER ID="352" NAME="Louis Grech" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report because the 112 service is key in ensuring affordable access to basic telecoms services, preventing social exclusion, offering social protection guarantees and ultimately acting as a lifeline to all EU citizens irrespective of where they are in the Union. Unfortunately, a recent survey has revealed that this system is not being fully utilised and that European citizens are still largely unaware of the existence of the 112 service: the EU average with regards to the EU citizens' knowledge of the 112 service as the EU-wide emergency number stands at just 26%, with countries like Malta falling below the average at 20%. Henceforth, Member States should focus on ameliorating this system by increasing the number of dedicated lines at call centres, develop a new software system aimed at monitoring the call handling system and step up efforts in improving and doubling the availability of human resources. On the side of the Commission, there needs to be development of a more targeted and far-reaching communication strategy which addresses the preoccupations and queries that citizens face with regards to the mechanics of the system; any action plan must necessarily take into account persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups.
<SPEAKER ID="352" NAME="Nathalie Griesbeck" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
in writing. - (FR) An emergency number which can be used anywhere in the European Union is an idea that I believe in. The number 112, which is accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, whether you are in Lisbon or Ljubljana, allows you to contact the emergency services under any circumstances. Yet despite this, Europeans are unaware of this number, which constitutes one of the most tangible achievements of the European Union. Given this assessment, I voted in favour of this resolution in order to promote the visibility of 112 among European citizens, in particular by displaying this number in all pharmacies and surgeries. Furthermore, the resolution intends to make caller localisation easier, since it is not yet completely reliable. A greater level of awareness among citizens, and improved technology - these two things should in the coming years make 112 an essential tool in the life of Europeans.
<SPEAKER ID="353" NAME="Françoise Grossetête" LANGUAGE="FR">
The emergency number 112 needs to be better known by our fellow citizens, as it enables the saving of lives. Today, the European Parliament wanted to improve communication in the Member States concerning this number, and I am glad about that.
<P>
Good reflexes can save lives, whether we are talking about an accident or an illness, when we are faced with the unexpected, when we are faced with distress or when we are faced with danger. 112, which is still too little known, is the single European emergency number. Everyone should have this number memorised. 112 is the single number for calling the emergency services - ambulances, firefighters, mobile accident units or police - 24 hours a day, seven days a week, wherever you are in Europe, however you make the call. One aspect of everyday life in Europe is knowing that millions of people can encounter a problem when travelling within a Member State of the Union. It is pointless to memorise the emergency number of every country in the Union; a single one is enough: 112!
<SPEAKER ID="353" NAME="Roberto Gualtieri" LANGUAGE="IT">
The single European emergency number 112 is a service that aims to ensure rapid access, free of charge, to emergency services for everyone throughout Europe, thus markedly simplifying access to the service, especially for people who are abroad.
<P>
Adoption of the Rapti report is Parliament's response to Europeans' scant knowledge and awareness of the potential of this service. This lack of information is certainly worrying.
<P>
Among the aims of the European Parliament resolution is in fact to carry out an effective information and awareness-raising campaign in key locations such as doctors' surgeries, pharmacies, schools, airports and stations, as well as to call for improvements in the quality, efficiency and accessibility of the single service, thus ensuring easy access even for people with disabilities and vulnerable individuals.
<P>
By providing the Commission with clear guidelines on how to improve use of the universal service, we have taken a step forwards in protecting people who live and travel in the Union, with particular attention to social and geographical inclusion.
<SPEAKER ID="353" NAME="Sylvie Guillaume" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted in favour of the report by my colleague, because it underlines well how fundamental the duties of universal service are as a safety net for social integration in the case of market dysfunction. The region that I represent is made up of rural and isolated areas. Citizens who live there must never be allowed to become victims of social exclusion; they must be able to benefit from affordable access to essential basic telecommunications services. To ensure this, the Commission must in particular allocate increased financial support to local projects allowing the opening up of such services.
<P>
Finally, as the summer holidays approach, it is worth highlighting the existence of a single emergency number which is valid throughout Europe, 112. This number is still too little known, but we still need to ensure that the system that has been introduced is also accessible to the most vulnerable people, disabled people in particular. The Member States have a great responsibility: they must ensure that this system is improved for the purposes of protecting citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="354" NAME="Ian Hudghton" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - Given increased mobility throughout the EU for business, work and leisure, it is clear that the 112 emergency number can be an important tool for allowing citizens to contact the emergency services anywhere with minimum fuss. It is equally clear that, for the tool to be effective, citizens must be aware of its existence. However, as the report rightly notes, individual Member States have existing, long-standing emergency numbers, and it is important that the two systems must be allowed to operate in parallel.
<SPEAKER ID="354" NAME="Juozas Imbrasas" AFFILIATION="EFD">

The report also focuses on the single European emergency number 112, introduced to enable citizens to call the emergency services by using one and the same number from anywhere in the EU. There is a need to raise awareness of the 112 emergency number and the fact that hitherto a poor quality of service has been provided to citizens through the 112 number. The 112 emergency number must receive the support it needs to become the best means of protecting citizens' lives, otherwise the results may outweigh all its benefits. However, I believe that internet access services also show a much greater price divergence across the EU, and this must be reduced. I believe that the Member States must take the necessary steps to reduce the number of unsuccessful emergency-call attempts, shorten call set-up and response times and reduce the number of hoax calls.
<SPEAKER ID="354" NAME="Jarosław Kalinowski" LANGUAGE="PL">
Access to telecommunications services is essential for the development of modern societies in the EU Member States. The introduction of universal broadband coverage provides us with opportunities to compensate for imbalances between the various regions of Europe. However, I agree with the rapporteur that it cannot be consumers themselves who bear the burden of the measures we take. The report raises the key issue of improvements to the emergency number 112. A uniform system makes the emergency services more effective and has helped to save lives on more than one occasion, and hence it is highly recommended that the EU institutions should support it.
<SPEAKER ID="355" NAME="Edvard Kožušník" AFFILIATION="ECR">
in writing. - (CS) The report generally gives an objective description of the current situation regarding universal services in telecommunications. I particularly applaud the fact that Parliament is aware of the importance of retaining a market environment in the area of telecommunications. The report itself demonstrates this in emphasising the need to avoid market disruption when enforcing the revised directive. Despite the fact that the report is on the whole balanced, I am slightly concerned about the call it makes to the Commission and the Member States to strengthen measures in support of demand and the introduction of new services, rather than just providing connectivity. In my opinion, this shows a failure to understand the role of the state in the area of telecommunications and in broadband connectivity policy. If the state is to function transparently and to avoid disrupting competition and market mechanisms, it can only support the natural development of broadband connectivity by providing high-quality e-government, e-health or e-learning services, in other words a high-quality offering. Any other measures to increase demand for broadband connectivity are almost always at the expense of the proper functioning of the market, and they disrupt competition to a lesser or greater extent.
<SPEAKER ID="356" NAME="Giovanni La Via" LANGUAGE="IT">
Since 1991, '112' has been the European emergency number that has enabled many people to get help in situations of dire need.
<P>
Voting in favour of Mrs Rapti's report today means promoting this instrument of assistance, which has helped to save a great many human lives, so that it is known and used in all EU countries as a single number to call to contact the emergency services anywhere in the Union.
<P>
To that end we need to strengthen initiatives to ensure that disadvantaged groups have digital access, by providing connections with free Internet access, not least in public buildings. Promoting investment in broadband may be a highly significant factor in achieving full use of the 112 number in all countries and in all areas that are often difficult to reach (mountains, rural areas and islands), so as to protect people by giving them the right to swift, appropriate assistance.

The European Parliament has repeatedly stressed both the need to educate the public about the importance and role of the 112 emergency number and the poor quality of the services which have been provided to citizens via this number. Therefore, this evaluation will be able to suggest new methods for raising citizens' awareness and ways of improving the 112 service.

In 1991, the creation of the single European emergency number '112' enabled Europeans to access all telecommunications services permitting voice calls to national emergency numbers.

Starting now, the Commission and the Member States must intensify their information campaigns so that the emergency number 112 is known by all the citizens of the Union and people who travel there, and they must organise and support promotional and public awareness activities. It is also essential to ensure that each segment of society has access to this service, including disabled people.
<P>
Significant improvements are required in the precision and reliability of information in relation to caller localisation. The emergency intervention services must ensure better coordination among themselves at national level, across borders and at European level in order to achieve the highest level of efficiency. Performance indicators must also be established concerning the quality of the 112 service, taking account in particular of needs regarding accessibility, multilingualism and high-quality and timely interventions.

With the development of the European Union and the removal of individual barriers to residence for EU citizens, it is also necessary to secure a single system for citizens and consumers living within the framework of the single market. The European emergency number 112 has a clear justification in this context, since it has great potential for saving lives and for the overall protection of EU citizens. It is therefore necessary to ensure access to this service for all levels of society, including disabled people (people with impaired hearing or speech etc.) and other vulnerable groups. It should therefore be a priority for the EU in the near future to increase awareness of the emergency number 112 and to increase its smooth operation throughout the Union, even in the most remote regions.

I voted in favour of this resolution, because the single European emergency number must function effectively, even in the remotest corner of Europe, so that, in the event of an accident, it is possible to call the emergency services free of charge. This is a vitally important service which must be of a particularly high quality. This emergency number must become the best means of protecting people's lives, and consequently needs to receive proper funding. Emergency services in every Member State must receive accurate and reliable caller location information, so that an emergency response can be provided in a timely manner. It is very important to ensure that vulnerable social groups and disabled people have suitable access to these services. Issues relating to technology and coordination need to be addressed as a matter of urgency. The number of unsuccessful emergency-call attempts must be reduced to a minimum, while call set-up and response times need to be lightning fast, because sometimes even a few seconds can mean the difference between life and death. Every European must know this number. Every Member State must increase public awareness, by using the media and other awareness-raising measures. The Member States must also cooperate more effectively with each other, by exchanging information and best practices. In the meantime, the Commission must take steps at EU level to develop a communication strategy, and establish key performance indicators and guidelines.
<SPEAKER ID="361" NAME="Alfredo Pallone" LANGUAGE="IT">
Every three years the Commission reviews the scope of the Universal Service Directive to adapt it to new requirements and to the increasingly essential role played by technology in providing people with assistance. The purpose of the universal service and the single European emergency number (112 - a single number for all countries in the Union) is to improve the safety net where basic social services are not guaranteed, to prevent social exclusion by ensuring access to essential services for rural communities and low-income groups, and to improve access to emergency services for people with disabilities. I voted in favour of the resolution because I also believe that the 112 number and the emergency services in general need to be given the prominence and the publicity they deserve for the role they can play in people's daily lives.

I voted in favour of the European Parliament resolution on the emergency number. The 112 number is a number that may save the lives of hundreds of European citizens who fall victim to accidents or illness. However, the problem is that, although this number has existed for several years, only 26% of EU citizens actually know that it exists. If this instrument is to become more flexible and practical, considerable improvements are needed in terms of automatic caller location identification, especially on roaming calls. These improvements call for additional resources, which it is hard for countries in economic difficulty, such as Greece, to find.

This report helps improve access to emergency services for people with disabilities and specifically raise the awareness of travellers, and imposes stricter obligations on caller location information, as well as on accuracy and reliability criteria in order to ensure the same response and treatment as in the case of calls made to national emergency numbers and where there is no access to technological facilities.

I would propose that all EU airports, seaports and border crossings prominently display signs showing that '112' is the phone number for emergency services throughout the EU. These signs should be displayed in arrival and departure areas, and at security points including passport control, to promote awareness of the service. With schools closed for the summer holidays and families heading off on their vacations it is important that people be aware of the '112' European Emergency Number. More must be done to promote awareness of this number and to improve the effectiveness and quality of emergency call systems. With the right technology upgrades dispatchers could be informed within seconds of the location of callers and we should look into this.

The Universal Service Directive was aimed at defining a set of universal services which, as the name suggests, should be provided to all citizens according to a good cost-benefit ratio. In the current context, investment is being made in broadband as an instrument supporting a networked economy at the service of European citizens. It is important, however, not to lose sight of other instruments that should be universally accessible. Beyond the mere provision of access to telecoms, this includes investment in the single European emergency number 112, which is especially at the service of those who find themselves in a situation of heightened vulnerability due to a range of reasons, such as a pathology that makes them more vulnerable or an accident when on holiday. A comprehensive reading needs to be carried out in order to fulfil the role of a Europe at the service of its people.

in writing. - (FR) Awareness and reliability - these are essentially the two messages sent out by the vote at noon on the resolution concerning 112, the European emergency number. The main message is that we need to promote awareness of 112, a free number accessible everywhere in Europe. That is the most important challenge. The task is immense, given that only 26% of Europeans can identify 112 as the emergency number in the Union, with enormous differences depending on the Member State in question. It is precisely these Member States who can make up for this lacuna through global and targeted campaigns focusing on awareness, information and promotion.
<P>
The next issue is reliability, particularly in relation to the precise and automatic localisation of the caller. This information is essential for ensuring the best possible reaction time by those who carry out the initial intervention. Everyone is aware of the imperative need for an emergency number which is reliable, both at home and abroad. Much has been done, but much remains to be done to make 112 a reflex response for every European citizen facing an emergency.
<SPEAKER ID="365" NAME="Robert Rochefort" LANGUAGE="FR">
Although, since 1991, the European emergency number 112 has enabled the saving of lives and better protection of citizens, most of them are still unaware of this number. This report makes some interesting proposals to ensure broader awareness of 112 among citizens; for example, using airports and stations, as well as surgeries and pharmacies, as privileged points for disseminating information on 112.

The report also calls on the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts in order to increase awareness of 112 among disabled people using means of communication that are well-adapted to their needs. That is the basic principle behind an idea that I supported through an amendment while the draft report was being scrutinised in the parliamentary committee, and I am pleased that it has been retained in the final report.

The report also calls on the Commission and the Member States to facilitate citizens' access to this number - in particular by considering the possibility of using text messages - as well as to improve the quality of emergency services - in particular by shortening intervention times and by developing geolocation for callers.

It was important for me to support this report because it emphasises the importance of 112, the single European emergency number. 112 allows you to call rescue services, ambulances, firefighters, mobile accident units or the police, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, wherever you are in Europe, and whatever means you use to call them: for example, a mobile telephone, a fixed-line telephone or a telephone box. 112 does not replace national emergency numbers, but works in parallel with them. In an emergency, having good reflexes can save lives. Unfortunately, this number is still too little known. The Rapti report allows us to take stock of the current system, and in particular its financing, call management - response time, calls in foreign languages, caller localisation, and so on - and the quality of access to the service for vulnerable or disabled people. 112 is one initiative that shows that Europe can be extremely useful and can simplify the lives of citizens. We must develop and promote this service.

I voted in favour of adopting the report on the emergency number 112, which saves Europeans' lives on a daily basis. I am in favour of the EU continuing to provide support for its increasingly effective operation. Implementing the idea of a single joint European emergency number has been an undoubted success for the EU. The number was introduced almost 20 years ago, but in February 2011, according to Eurobarometer, only 26% of Europeans knew of its existence and were able to name it as the emergency number which makes it possible to contact the police, fire brigade or ambulance service from anywhere in the EU. The Member States should therefore take more effective steps to disseminate information about the 112 number. Early education is of particular importance. I am in favour of greater financial support for educational projects involving the youngest members of society. We must teach children to respond appropriately in dangerous situations, including the proper use of emergency numbers and what information they need to give to the operator.

The proposal to lay broadband in every nook and cranny of Europe is also absurd. It would be like connecting every village in Europe via a four-lane motorway. The Netherlands has excellent Internet connections - we do not need a European policy in this area.

This report is about the importance of the single European emergency number 112, with emphasis on its visibility and awareness among citizens.

The Member States should ensure a universal service for all technologies related to access to broadband. The Commission is called upon to ensure that the 112 number is effectively operational throughout the EU, and accessible to the entire public. It is worth emphasising the need for the number to be accessible to people with different disabilities and vulnerable groups, by providing devices for hearing- or visually-impaired users, text relay or sign language services, or other specific equipment. In view of this, it seems to me to be fitting to improve the reliability of information about the location of the caller. It will also be vital for the new European rules on telecoms to decide on the updating of existing technology in order to improve automatic call localisation.

in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of this report. After many years, the fact that the single European emergency number, 112, is now available throughout Europe and on the mobile phone network represents a major success. However, in the long term we still need to ensure that all telecom service providers offer this number free of charge to the Member States. This project has produced significant added value for Europe.

in writing. - (DE) The Consumer Markets Scoreboard shows that the telecom market and Internet service providers receive the most complaints. The provision of the single European emergency number, 112, should allow EU citizens to call the emergency services at any time and from any location, however inaccessible. The review every three years of the Universal Service Directive should also make it clear whether further improvements are needed. The intention of the Europe 2020 strategy is to make broadband services available to every EU citizen by 2013 and faster broadband by 2020, with the aim of improving social inclusion and competitiveness. I have voted in favour of this report.
<SPEAKER ID="372" NAME="Artur Zasada" LANGUAGE="PL">
I supported the motion for a resolution during today's vote. After the consultations I held last year with rural homemakers' clubs, I know how important access to universal services is in rural areas. The directive on universal service will prevent social exclusion, since one of the things guaranteed by its provisions is that citizens of rural areas will have access to basic and essential telecommunications services at favourable prices. This will undoubtedly help to raise awareness of the emergency number 112.
<P>
The latest Eurobarometer survey published in early 2011 shows that only 26% of EU citizens know that they should dial 112 if they want to call the emergency services within EU territory, and 58% of EU citizens still believe that the residents of their country have not been properly informed about the existence of the emergency number. This is a very alarming situation. As a rule, EU citizens know the number to call for the police, fire brigade or ambulance service in their own Member State, but if they are abroad and have to call for assistance, they are helpless.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Luís Paulo Alves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I am voting for this report, and I welcome in particular the agreement that has been reached on consumer access in terms of access, quality and information, and which safeguards the role of traditional trade. The most significant proposed amendments, and those which add to the value of this report, are undoubtedly those of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D Group) in relation to improving working conditions, combating the parallel economy of the retail sector and the implementation of suitable labour and social legislation in the fight against tax evasion and the black market, with the aim of maintaining levels of employment and investing in training for workers.

Last July, the European Commission published a report on monitoring the retail and distribution market. Its aim was to propose a review of the sector by analysing its economic, social and environmental performance, so that an assessment could then be made of the improvements that needed to be made. Our colleague Mrs Corazza Bildt has prepared a report on behalf of Parliament. It calls, in particular, for an integrated European action plan for the sector in order to encourage retailers and suppliers to engage in an active dialogue that can lead to innovative solutions with the support of the European Union. As I support the general orientation of the report, I voted in favour of it.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Zigmantas Balčytis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report. EU citizens are as yet unable to exploit all the advantages offered by the single market, such as choosing goods and services at competitive prices. This is particularly true in less economically developed Member States, where people have to pay similar prices for goods and services as those living in countries that have made greater economic progress. This largely happens because the market is focused on wholesale trade, which is able to offer more favourable prices thanks to its large market share. Today we have the problem that divergent interpretations of EU single market legislation are being applied in the Member States, which fundamentally impedes free movement of goods and services in the EU and creates additional costs for consumers and retailers, in particular SMEs, thus limiting the potential usefulness of the single market to European citizens and the business world. I agree that the Commission needs to further analyse price differences in the EU, using adequate statistical tools, in order to ensure greater price transparency and comparability for consumers, without prejudice to national fiscal and labour market rules, thereby promoting more enlightened choices and greater confidence in cross-border trade.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Regina Bastos" LANGUAGE="PT">
The retail sector represents 20% of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), generates 4.2% of EU Gross Domestic Product and employs almost 20 million people. This is a key sector for the revival of the single market and for achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. Despite the progress that has been made in this area, this report, which I voted for, calls for the adoption of measures to strengthen the retail market, namely: opening up markets to businesses and removing the obstacles and difficulties that many businesses face, especially SMEs; exploring the full potential of e-commerce, while strengthening the trust of businesses and consumers, and improving the Single European Payment Area in order to develop a payment service available for all types of cards, thereby increasing transparency in transaction costs and removing unjustified interchange fees; and ensuring faster bank transfers within the EU. Finally, I would like to highlight the idea of the Commission tabling a European Plan of Action for Retail, to define a strategy to address outstanding issues, with recommendations at a sectoral level.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Mara Bizzotto" LANGUAGE="IT">

The document expresses and advocates many of the principles that the Lega Nord has always put at the heart of its programme, particularly as regards defending small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and small retailers.
<P>
Among the various aspects highlighted by the report, I particularly welcome the points that express the concern felt by SMEs at the growth of shopping centres and the decline of local shops and markets. Similarly, I particularly welcome the report's aim of stressing that SMEs constitute the backbone of the European economy and have a unique role to play in creating jobs. I also welcome the rapporteur's aim of denouncing unfair practices that affect small retailers and, in many cases, consumers themselves. For the reasons given above, my vote was decidedly in favour.

The retail sector is a pillar of the European economy, because this market employs almost 20 million people and represents 20% of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Too often, new national barriers are raised to protect jobs and SMEs. Instead, trade barriers in Europe should be removed to promote jobs and SMEs. Nonetheless, the legitimate concerns of people losing jobs and SMEs losing business have to be taken seriously during the financial and economic crisis. Dialogue must be intensified at all levels to improve understanding, restore confidence and address difficulties. I agree that the time has come to recognise the retail sector's achievements, specific problems and challenges. I therefore agree with the call made by the European Parliament to develop an integrated European action plan for retail, to establish policy guidelines and provide concrete proposals on the best way of addressing outstanding issues.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Vito Bonsignore" LANGUAGE="IT">
I welcome the spirit of this report, the aim of which is to support the removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods and services.
<P>
I voted in favour of this document, which also has the merit of seeking to streamline current legislation and to take action against restrictive national measures, which are often damaging and costly for small and medium-sized enterprises. The European Union must take decisive action to remove the protectionist obstacles that restrict enterprises' access to the single market. At the same time, it must encourage any initiative that can reduce market dominance by a small number of actors, thus ensuring contractual freedom and protecting consumers.
<P>
I agree with the approach suggested by the rapporteur of setting up a system of self-regulation involving retailers and the supply chain, while the EU should focus on public-private partnership measures.
<P>
Lastly, we need to increase the penetration of e-commerce, which can reduce the distance between consumers and products, and to introduce policies designed to restore confidence in the economic system by harmonising intra-EU payments and providing businesses with a system that is no longer fragmented and costly.
<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Cristian Silviu Buşoi" LANGUAGE="RO">
I think that this is an excellent report because of its conciseness and the quality of the solutions proposed in it. The retail market is particularly important not only in consumers' everyday lives, but also for jobs in the EU. This is why I believe that making this market more efficient is a priority. I feel that the form of dialogue between all the actors in the distribution chain, suggested by the rapporteur for resolving the current problems affecting the market's operation, is actually the most suitable and constructive. I support the notion of creating a European payment area in the true sense of the term by harmonising payments within the EU, thereby reducing the commission on these payments. Furthermore, I too think that efforts to offer consumers' freedom of choice must be stepped up. We need to encourage not only e-commerce but also small local stores which can meet the demands of certain consumers. Last but not least, this report tackles in a logical manner the issue of unfair commercial practices and competition on the retail market. It is very true that sometimes large operators can abuse their market power. However, I believe that we need to look at the bigger picture and not ignore that large operators too are possibly victims of unfair practices.
<SPEAKER ID="374" NAME="Antonio Cancian" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the report by Mrs Corazza Bildt since it represents a significant step forwards in modernising the retail and distribution sector.
<P>
I particularly welcome the non-regulatory line proposed by the rapporteur, which places the emphasis on exploring other means before resorting to new regulation. The report shows, in fact, that appropriate rules exist but inadequate enforcement hinders free movement. At the same time, the interests of European traders and entrepreneurs need to be protected by means of a fully operational single market in which the barriers that prevent it from operating smoothly are removed.
<P>
In this respect it is essential to mention two important pieces of legislation that help to stimulate the growth of operators in the sector: the Single Market Act and the Small Business Act. Their aim is to 'simplify life for small and medium-sized enterprises' by reducing the administrative burdens they bear. All this must be governed by the principle of subsidiarity.
<P>
Lastly, a section that deserves special attention is the one on improving efficiency and sustainability by encouraging the retail sector to invest in innovative solutions for logistics and transport, energy efficiency, packaging and waste disposal.
<SPEAKER ID="374" NAME="Carlos Coelho" LANGUAGE="PT">
The retail market undoubtedly functions as a driver of growth, competitiveness and employment in Europe, and it can make a key contribution to achieving the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy. It is essential to build a more efficient, transparent and fairer retail market through an active contribution from the retailers and suppliers themselves, to be complemented at Community level through strengthening of coordination among the different policies and adopting a comprehensive and long-term approach to this sector.
<P>
We have to tackle the remaining obstacles to the free movement of goods and services in the EU, especially the existence of more restrictive national rules, divergent interpretations and inadequate enforcement of these rules, which end up limiting the potential of the single market at the service of European citizens and businesses. At the same time, competition rules must be applied properly to prevent abuse of a dominant position or unfair trade practices, and if necessary provide the opportunity for access to simpler, less time-consuming and more transparent infringement procedures. I am in favour of Mrs Bildt's excellent report, along with its call for the drafting of an integrated European Action Plan for Retail.

It is therefore important to remove all obstacles to its smooth operation, particularly at the level of the retail sector, which employs nearly 20 million people, generates 4.2% of the EU's Gross Domestic Product, and represents 20% of European small and medium-sized enterprises. The report identifies five priority areas for a more efficient retail market: (i) ensuring greater competitiveness and growth, and boosting employment; (ii) removing existing obstacles to the free movement of goods and services; (iii) opening up market access to consumers and businesses; (iv) addressing contractual and commercial practices in business-to-business relations; (v) enhancing efficiency and innovative practices.

The sector of small and medium-sized enterprises, which includes retail, obviously has a key impact in boosting the economy, especially in terms of promoting employment and the so-called middle class. The retail trade is of paramount importance for economic and social cohesion, so I support the call for the drafting of an integrated European Action Plan on Retail, with a view to defining a framework of action with concrete and pragmatic proposals for resolving outstanding issues. I would therefore like to congratulate the author of this report for her contribution to removing the barriers to the free movement of goods and services, defending the interests of businesses and consumers, promoting their access to the market, and increasing efficiency and sustainable consumption. In this way we are encouraging competitiveness, growth and employment.
<SPEAKER ID="375" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report concerns a sector where the problems are all too obvious. Particularly in countries where the fabric of business is made up of a large number of family-like micro and small enterprises, the retail trade is facing the effects of decreased purchasing power among the general public, adding to the overwhelming weight and unfair competition exerted by large distributors.
<P>
These are problems and difficulties that threaten the viability and future of a sector which, it is worth remembering, plays an important social role, particularly, but not exclusively, outside the main urban areas. However, the report does not address the root causes of this situation, despite this being necessary in order to remedy it. It ignores the effects of deregulation and the liberalisation of trade that the EU has been actively promoting, the associated impact on the proliferation of supermarkets and the unbridled increase of their power and influence, and it does not address the consequences of liberalisation and privatisation, the reduction in purchasing power among the public, the increase in interest rates and the difficulty of accessing credit. Its route is precisely the opposite: it insists on deepening the single market, which exacerbates the difficulties of small enterprises and the retail trade, as reality shows us only too well.
<SPEAKER ID="376" NAME="Ilda Figueiredo" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report contains many contradictions. It is true that retail is suffering severe attacks, particularly in countries where this trade is made up of a large number of family-run micro and small enterprises, and where, in certain cases, the purchasing power of the public is decreasing. It is suffering most of all in less urban areas, where these businesses play an important social role, and where they are experiencing a time of turmoil.
<P>
However, the report forgets the fundamental cause of this situation and is not sufficiently critical of the liberalisation of trade, the proliferation of supermarkets, the consequences of liberalisation and privatisation, the reduction in purchasing power among the public, the increase in interest rates and the difficulty of accessing credit. Quite the contrary: it insists on the establishment of the internal market, which exacerbates the difficulties of small enterprises and the retail trade. We therefore voted against this report.

It is a dynamic market, employing almost 20 million people, generating 4.2% of the EU's GDP, and accounting for 20% of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Europe. Retailers are also service providers, active at the forefront of new sales methods and offering easy access to the labour market. Although the retail sector has fared relatively well in the crisis, trade is becoming more difficult in the EU due to mounting economic nationalism. It is necessary to put the real economy at the centre of political programmes once more, and to work towards opening up the freedom to travel and to take up residence throughout Europe. These freedoms are based on transparent trade relations and sustainable consumption. Too often, new international obstacles are erected in the interests of protecting jobs and SMEs. Instead of this, trade barriers in Europe should be removed in the interests of supporting jobs and SMEs. Despite this, we must take seriously people's justified concerns about job losses and the concerns of SMEs over the loss of business opportunities seriously during the current public debt crisis. It is right to acknowledge the results achieved to date, as well as the specific problems and challenges of the retail sector. At the same time, I believe it is appropriate to apply a targeted European action plan for the retail sector, creating a political framework with concrete proposals providing pragmatic solutions to outstanding issues.

The rapporteur recognises in principle that it is up to the Member States to define their shop location policy. It is a pity, however, that the rest of the report goes exactly in the opposite direction, and in favour of the recommendations made to France by Brussels in the context of the European semester: namely, there would not be enough competition in the sector, and all regulation on locating retail outlets would be a hindrance to this competition.
<P>
Strangely, the oligopolistic way in which purchasing groups are organised, and the abuse of their dominant position, as well as certain commercial practices which can be criticised, do not seem to bring about a reaction. Furthermore, when it comes to putting right the asymmetric and unfair relationships between the different stakeholders in the distribution chain, from production to retail, we are content with having dialogue between the stakeholders, which shows that some people are living on a different planet.
<P>
Thus, priority is given to competition, Brussels-style. This will have the kinds of consequences that we are all suffering at the moment: farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) strangled by excessively low prices, consumers hit by excessively high prices and, in the middle, a large number of intermediaries who are doing a lot better because of their often unjustified margins, which are enormous. As is logical, I voted against this report.

in writing. - I am in agreement with this report because it highlights the importance of taking a more holistic long-term approach to the EU retail sector, one which is consistent and better coordinated to address the market exigencies which existed prior to and following the financial crisis. The aftermath of the crisis has shown us that the European retail market still holds areas of growth and untapped potential and can serve as an important catalyst to harness growth, competitiveness and job creation within a renewed Single Market. Therefore, the Commission should map out its action plan carefully and base any strategy to improve the Single Market for retail on the basis of 'ex ante' and 'ex post' consultations with SMEs in order to be able to draw out the effects which measures at EU and national level can have on competitiveness and employment levels of businesses, in particular of micro and small businesses within the EU. In the case of consumer protection, I call on the Commission to consolidate an easily accessible user-friendly mechanism containing data on the economic, social, ethical and environmental performance of retailers operating within the Single Market, so as to enable consumers to enjoy a more integrated retail market within which they are able to make better choices.

Retailers are also service providers, at the cutting edge of new and diverse ways of shopping, such as direct selling, and offer easy access to labour markets. Member States must fully and correctly implement the internal market rules and legislation, notably the Goods Package, the Services Directive, the Late Payments Directive, the E-Commerce Directive, the Small Business Act and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. They must also remove overlaps and reduce administrative burdens and regulatory barriers that may limit growth and job creation. Attention must be drawn to the concern expressed by parts of civil society and SMEs about the increase in shopping centres and the decline in local shops and markets in remote areas and town centres. I believe that we must offer incentives to renovate urban building stock, using the Structural Funds, and that this could allow utility rates to be reduced (public-private partnership) and could facilitate the return of businesses, particularly local ones, which are instrumental to economic and social development.

in writing - (LV) I should like to emphasise once more that the most important task of today's European politicians is to encourage economic growth and Member States' recovery from the recession. We must realise that protectionism is not the way to achieve economic growth, because it inhibits the creation of jobs and the free flow of goods between Member States. Protectionism is a short-term measure that can create short-term improvement and have public support, but in the long term it will create new, more serious, economic problems. The report focuses on the retail sector, which has a very important place in Europe's economy, employing about 20 million people, and accounting for about 4.2% of the European economy. Unfortunately, with the economic crisis this sector in particular has been badly hit, and this has adversely affected people's living standards and income. For precisely this reason I support the suggestions made in the report, which are aimed at improving the work of the retail sector, which will in turn encourage economic growth and the creation of new jobs. The report focuses on five themes, the most important of which for me is the encouragement of competition and the opening-up of Member States' markets to cross-border trade. I support the call to supplement existing legislation and to strictly follow up how the Member States implement it in their own law. We have the power to make the necessary changes in order to make Europe's economy stronger.

It particularly focuses on a whole series of administrative obstacles that actually prevent the free movement of goods throughout the Union. I applaud the fact that the report emphasises the need for Commission intervention against any Member State violating the principles of the single market. The report also acknowledges that Member States are responsible for their own policies on business location, and the Union should not intervene in the arrangements which Member States themselves conclude in this area. The main message of the report is, in my opinion, the emphasis on competition law as an instrument for protection against abuse of dominant position or significant market power.
<P>
The report is thus free of the modish tendency to favour the creation of new laws for this area, preferring instead to make use of existing legal instruments. I applaud the fact that the report, in contrast to many other reports emanating from the European Parliament, focuses on the essential meaning of European integration, in other words a functioning single market, and respects the fact that contract freedom and consumer protection must form the basis of market relations, while not disrupting market dynamics.

The retail sector represents a reserve of growth for Europe's internal market and, at the same time, it can provide consumers with greater transparency and facilitate final price comparisons.

In view of this multifaceted, strategic role, I have given my full support to Mrs Corazza Bildt's report, since we need to take much-needed action to harmonise legislation in this sector as soon as possible. I would point out that this sector provides access to goods and services in difficult areas (rural, mountainous and sparsely populated areas, and so on) where the presence of small retailers and local markets is a service to the community.
<P>
While I hope the comprehensive European action plan for retail will soon be drafted, I look forward to the completion of the process currently taking place in the Member States of implementing those directives (on late payments, e-commerce, services, and so on) that this Parliament has already deemed to be important levers for the European market.

Finally, I believe that by voting in favour I have made an important contribution to the process of simplification and reduction of administrative burdens for European retailers and others, thus removing obstacles and barriers that could slow growth and job creation in the European Union.

It is important to coordinate the different policies that have an impact on this sector, which is a genuine motor of growth within the Union, in order to derive its full potential. While there are many shopping centres being developed, the number of local shops is diminishing, which means that we have to have a more global approach in order to facilitate access to trade at all levels.

In the amendments that I tabled, which were incorporated into the report that we voted on today, I also wanted to emphasise the social, cultural and environmental role played by local trade. I also support the global approach taken by our rapporteur, which aims to encourage dialogue between the various players in the retail sector. I do think, though, that legislators must take their responsibilities seriously if that proves necessary. This is the case, in particular, as regards the kinds of unfair practices that can take place in this sector. It is therefore important to strengthen the legal mechanisms that allow small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to ensure that their rights are taken seriously, because these enterprises often have little negotiating power when faced with large shopping centres.

Free and fair competition, freedom of contract and the rapid application of the relevant legislation are fundamental preconditions for a functioning retail market, and the Commission and the Member States must therefore promote them consistently and fully. In the interests of the proper application of competition rules and the prevention of features associated with a dominant market position - cartel agreements and unfair competition between retailers on regional markets - it is above all necessary to strengthen local bodies monitoring competition and to secure their cooperation with the European Commission's Directorate General for Competition.

Retail is indeed a pillar of the European economy, with strong roots that have enabled it to weather the crisis better than other sectors. However, there are still several problem areas, starting with the difficulty for the smallest retailers to remain in the market, because of the ever-present trend towards encouraging major outlets. The report is therefore right to highlight these problem areas and to call for the protection and development of smaller businesses, which are essential drivers of growth and employment in rural and outlying areas.
<P>
I would also like to highlight the fact that the report includes a specific reference to itinerant street vendors, who, like other groups, would be victims of any disastrous enforcement of the Services Directive. The economic, historical and cultural traditions that characterise a country cannot be thrown out at a stroke, thus also depriving consumers of the widest possible freedom of choice.

It should be noted that small and medium-sized enterprises play a major role in the areas of employment and value creation. They are particularly important for life in rural areas and city centres. Consequently, we must make every effort to ensure that large shopping centres do not drive local shops and markets out of city centres and remote areas. Conditions must be created for small retailers to take better advantage of the freedoms of the single market. We must encourage them to develop their services.

Indeed, the retail sector, as stated in the report, is a pillar of the European economy, a market that represents 4.2 % of EU Gross Domestic Product and 20% of European small and medium-sized enterprises, and which employs almost 20 million people. A sector of this size deserves attention from all of us and the creation of the necessary measures to support and develop it. The growing economic nationalism that we have seen is hindering trade in the EU. While old barriers are still in place, new ones are being created, affecting the business climate as well as investment and job creation by foreign retailers. At a time of crisis and in the face of these difficulties, I believe that it is essential to step up dialogue at all levels in order to improve understanding, restore confidence and respond to the difficulties of small and medium-sized enterprises. The specific problems and challenges that the retail sector is facing need to be addressed. I voted in favour, as I also agree with the call to draft an integrated European Action Plan for Retail.
<SPEAKER ID="384" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
The retail sector is perhaps the most visible part of the programme for Community action, not only for its emphasis on the economy, but because it is hinged on the moment when trade brings together professionals and consumers and makes the reality of the common area tangible. However, this is an area which features delicate problems that need to be given careful attention. Among these problems is the fact that some national states have put up obstacles - indirectly, such as through the laying down of rules that make specific requirements for packaging - to the marketing of foreign products; private labels have been causing concern among the right holders of reference marks; and on another level, some retailers, often part of distribution networks, have used their strong bargaining power to crush the margins of producers. These are cases that may jeopardise the single, free and competitive market, and endanger one of the fundamental purposes of the Community project. This is one point that should not be left off the agenda, as the rapporteur says.
<SPEAKER ID="384" NAME="Robert Rochefort" LANGUAGE="FR">
I am pleased that Parliament is highlighting the need to ensure that prices are more transparent and comparable for European consumers, and, with this in mind, to improve active cooperation among national statistical agencies in the exchange of comparable data. I also amended the report in the committee to reflect this. Furthermore, the report insists that the consumer's freedom of choice should be preserved, which is why particular attention must be paid to local retailers, who play a role in the accessibility of goods and services to all and in the preservation of jobs, particularly in the most backward regions. This report also reminds us, quite rightly, of the need to expand online trade and to increase consumer confidence in this area, for example by improving access to the Internet in those regions of the Union which need it, as well as improving the security of online payments. Finally, the report proposes developing a global European action plan for retail trade developed by the Commission in cooperation with the retail sector, and I would like to see this European action plan come about. For all these reasons, I have supported this excellent report.

This INI report aims to analyse barriers to a fair and more efficient retail market, and to make recommendations for an eventual Commission action plan in this area The Rapporteur was advised to keep to IMCO competences and not to digress into other issues such as those covered by José Bové's AGRI own-initiative report on a fair revenues for farmers. Shadows' meetings were largely consensual and all groups signed all compromise amendments apart from one which Greens/EFA and S&D could not sign. This amendment which we could not sign relates to collective redress and we wanted text mentioning a possible legislative proposal from the Commission if appropriate. Shadows were not able to come to an agreement so we had a separate vote on our amendments on collective redress (which we lost). Overall, the report was OK for us so Greens/EFA voted in favour.

The retail sector, a pillar of the European economy in that it accounts for 4.2% of the EU's Gross Domestic Product, needs to be strengthened by means of a European action plan to promote fair and transparent trading relations and sustainable consumption. The fragmentation of rules on movement and restrictive national measures result in unnecessary red tape, which hinders free trade. Similarly, payment systems within the EU also need to be harmonised. Lastly, unleashing the potential of e-commerce would help to bring consumers and producers closer together.

The proper functioning of the European Union requires a more efficient and fairer retail market. Economic growth is affected not only by large corporations and enterprises, but also by small businesses operating in the retail market. We should not forget that these small businesses are one of the reasons why we can talk about opportunities for new investments and new prospects for the EU. We must therefore put in place solutions which make them more efficient and which ensure that they are treated more fairly. We must support the retail market and strive to improve it, since - as I mentioned above - these businesses make a significant contribution to the growth which is so important for the future of Europe. It has been said, and quite rightly so, that we should concentrate on observing and enforcing the legislation already in force, and not on creating new regulations, in order to avoid yet more bureaucracy.

Unfortunately the number of national barriers which have a negative impact on the free movement of goods and services is continuing to increase. The report calls on the Member States to make these basic freedoms available throughout the entire European Union on the basis of fair, balanced and transparent trading relationships. In addition, they must invest in innovative solutions for transport, logistics, energy efficiency, packaging and waste disposal in order to give the retail sector access to high-quality products.

A surplus of over EUR 4.5 billion is in fact to be redistributed among the Member States in the form of a reduction in their scheduled contributions for next year. I believe it is worth emphasising that, although a reduction in the national contribution is a help especially at a time of economic crisis, we must not start seeing the crisis as grounds for reducing the overall budget in future.

The surpluses that have made it possible to reduce the contribution for the next financial year stem from enforcement of competition policy and from the proceeds of fines and interest on late payments. Such receipts could therefore have been entered in the Union budget without touching the income from national contributions.

A legal basis needs to be established to allow the EU to regard such surpluses as own resources, so that it can use them in the public-private partnership system to develop priority infrastructure in the telecoms, transport and energy sectors.

In this Draft Amending Budget, the surplus of EUR 4 539 394 283 from the 2010 financial year is entered into the 2011 budget, and this value allows the overall contribution of the Member States towards the 2011 EU budget to be reduced. I voted for this Draft Amending Budget because it is in accordance with Article 15 of the Financial Regulation. I believe, however, that the EU should take the necessary measures to ensure that, in future, the value of the EU budget surplus no longer makes up credit for the contributing Member States, and instead automatically goes towards strengthening the following year's budget, thus expanding the capacity for Community intervention on behalf of the European project and socio-economic cohesion.

The Council has shown itself to be critical of this position.

The decision therefore comes down to the reduction of this 2010 surplus (EUR 4.54 billion) in accordance with the contributions of the Member States for the 2011 budget. This means that the reductions in question are much larger in countries with stronger economies than in countries with weaker economies. Take the example of Germany, with a reduction of EUR 923 million, compared with Portugal, with a reduction of EUR 59 million, a situation that ends up increasing unfairness in the distribution of the surplus and jeopardises the principle of the Community budget's redistributive function, which underlies any real cohesion policy.

Paragraph 3 states that 'the budgetary authority shall discuss them with due account for their urgency'. The Regulation stipulates that the balance from each financial year, whether surplus or deficit, is entered as revenue or expenditure in the budget of the subsequent financial year through an amending budget to be submitted by the Commission within 15 days of the submission of the provisional accounts. By incorporating the surplus into the budget, the overall contribution of Member States towards funding the EU budget is reduced accordingly. The overall reduction for individual Member States will also be affected by an updated forecast of own resources (traditional own resources, value added tax and gross national income), including the updated United Kingdom correction amount. In June, within the framework of a separate Draft Amending Budget, the Commission will present updated forecasts which should lead to further changes in the contributions of individual countries. The aim of the third Amending Budget is to incorporate the surplus from the 2010 budget, amounting to EUR 4 539 394 283, into the new budget. Through this method, the overall contribution of Member States towards the 2011 EU budget will therefore be reduced accordingly.

Most of the income (EUR 1.28 billion out of EUR 1.8 billion) comes from interest on late payments and fines. The under-spend of EUR 2.72 billion is the result of under-implementation of programmes, under-implementation of non-mobilised reserves, under-implementation in other sections of the budget, and under-execution of credits carried over from 2009 to 2010. The European Parliament believes that the income calculated from interest on late payments and fines should not be considered as a surplus and should therefore not be deducted from the Member States' contributions (own resources based on GNI). Such income, stemming from the enforcement of EU competition policy, should be immediately put back and reinvested in the EU budget.

Amending budget No 3/2011 relates to the surplus of EUR 4.54 billion resulting from the budget for the financial year 2010. It recalls that in 2010 there was already a surplus of EUR 2.25 billion. It should be noted here that delays in the implementation of approved projects and consequent payments have contributed to this surplus, along with the interest accumulated due to delays in implementing projects and the fines charged to the Member States following the non-application or violation of Community standards. It is worth noting that of the aforementioned surplus, EUR 1.8 billion corresponds to penalties and interest gathered during the delay in implementing projects. This annual surplus is deducted proportionally from the contributions made by each Member State to the Union budget. Although the rapporteur and the Committee on Budgets understand that the surplus resulting from interest accumulated due to delays in implementing projects and the fines charged to the Member States should not revert to the Member States, this is revenue from the implementation of EU law.

Effective consumer protection laws are critically important in regard to the single market. There must be a strong, clear legal framework to ensure that consumers are fully confident when paying for goods or services anywhere in the EU. There are problems with the regulations as they are at present. Differences between national laws add to the delays and high costs which are often involved. In addition, the Consumer Protection Network is not operating at full capacity because of lack of cooperation from the Member States. It is consumers who are adversely affected by this, with rogue traders exploiting the weaknesses within the system to make a profit. A progressive approach is the one recommended in the report in order to amend the directive, allowing the CPC to function correctly and to provide proper protection for European consumers. A comprehensive assessment from the Commission, as recommended in the report, would greatly help to identify the weaknesses in consumer protection laws and to frame responses to those weaknesses. Consumer rights must be at the heart of any legislation proposed in future.

It partially harmonises the authorities' investigative and enforcement powers by laying down mechanisms for exchanging relevant information and taking measures to stop infringements in cross-border situations. Based on recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection, this report, which I voted for, focuses on the proposed amendments and updating of the regulation in question. Legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection should be removed, and references to old legislation no longer in force should be updated.

In 2006 the regulation currently in force established the consumer protection cooperation (CPC) network, the aim of which is to monitor and enforce legislation which protects consumers' interests. The legislation which falls within the scope of the CPC network is listed in the annex to the regulation. The objective of the proposed amending regulation is to update the contents of the annex to reflect recent legislative developments in the field of consumer protection. The update of the annex will consist of the removal from the annex of legislation which is not relevant for consumer protection cooperation between the national enforcement authorities and the replacement of references to old legislation which is no longer in force with references to new legislation in the field of consumer protection.

There is a great deal of talk about cross-border cooperation and about its benefits. However, we have seen in practice that, when it comes to trade, we also need to factor the protection of European consumers into the equation. This is especially true where there are sellers or suppliers who illegally evade enforcement of the legislation to the detriment of law-abiding traders. At the moment, there is insufficient information on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws. However, until we receive new information about how the system operates, I would like to make a few remarks supporting the inclusion on the political agenda of the subject of cross-border enforcement of consumers' interests. At the moment, each country sets its own priorities, especially as we do not have a common set of priorities which we can refer to. I believe that, in order to win and retain the confidence of European consumers, the Commission needs to create these reference points. It is vital for us to have laws that protect consumers, which they are familiar with and can refer to in the event of deviations. Consumer confidence is a valuable asset which is both difficult to win and easy to lose during times of crisis.

in writing. - (CS) I agree with the need to review the regulation creating an EU-wide network of competent public bodies for the enforcement of consumer protection law in the Member States (the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) network), which came into operation in December 2006. The review takes the form of an update of the annex in order to reflect the latest legislative developments in the area of consumer protection. The last Commission report from 2009 on the application of the CPC Regulation revealed a series of doubts relating to the system for cross-border promotion of the consumer acquis, consisting, for example, in the fact that a considerable number of registered authorities are not connected to the system, or do not make active use of it. The increasing length of time taken to handle requests is another problem. Apart from this, it is necessary to resolve the continuing fragmentation of procedural rules for enforcing the legislation. The different systems of national legislation and systems for enforcing legislation make it difficult to combat infringements of legislation in the EU effectively. Some public bodies have effective resources to hand for ending infringements of the legislation, while others must turn to the courts and face lengthy procedures. The costs of court proceedings can also cause problems, particularly if the requesting body is not able to cover the possible costs of court proceedings. The fact that requests always take longer than agreed (more than 150 days at present) can partly be explained by the greater complexity of cross-border cases, but it is often a matter of failing to stick to deadlines.

Consumer rights and protection under Community law is one of the fundamental principles of the workings of the internal market.

At a time when many transactions and contracts are made across borders, and online transactions are assuming a new prominence, cooperation between the different public authorities responsible for implementing legislation on consumer protection should be as stringent as possible, in order to ensure a higher level of protection and boost confidence.

in writing. - (SK) The regulation amends the existing Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection laws, the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Regulation. The network established under this Regulation monitors consumer protection legislation and promotes its implementation. The draft amending regulation has the aim of updating the contents of the Annex so that it reflects the latest developments in consumer protection legislation. As the current results of cross-border cooperation in the enforcement of consumer protection legislation are unsatisfactory, we need to take appropriate measures to correct the situation. A more complex approach to the scope of the regulation is necessary, with the aim of applying it to all EU legislation having an impact on the collective interests of consumers. I believe that the cross-border enforcement of consumer interests should be put at the forefront of the political agenda. The improved cooperation between the national bodies responsible for enforcing legislation should be developed into a highly effective remedy in the hands of European consumers, and should boost their confidence in the single market.

The regulation is intended to efficiently and effectively tackle cross-border rogue traders who disrupt the smooth functioning of the internal market, and thus increase consumer confidence in taking up cross-border offers, and prevent sellers and suppliers from evading enforcement to the competitive detriment of law-abiding sellers and suppliers. The regulation achieves its aims by establishing an EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer laws in the Member States (the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network). The network established by the regulation monitors and enforces legislation which protects consumers' interests. The CPC Regulation partially harmonises the authorities' investigative and enforcement powers and lays down the mechanisms for exchanging relevant information and/or taking enforcement action to stop infringements in cross-border situations.

In an era of a Europe without borders which grants equal rights and privileges to all of its citizens, consumer protection legislation should guarantee the same rights and opportunities to all customers within the single market. Meanwhile, the large discrepancies between the national legal systems result in a variety of regulatory breaches, and make it more difficult to prevent and eliminate violations. It is essential to ensure the proper coordination of measures at European level, and to improve cooperation in this field between the competent bodies. It is essential to carry out an accurate analysis of the regulations in force and to eliminate legislative loopholes in order to boost consumer confidence and guarantee consumers an appropriate level of legal protection.

The regulation aims to abolish the barriers to cooperation between public enforcement authorities to allow them 'to detect, investigate and bring about the cessation or prohibition of intra-EU infringements of the laws which protect consumers' interests'. As a result of the removal of the borders, rogue traders have come up with new ideas for defrauding consumers.

New technologies can hinder the authorities' ability to enforce consumer laws effectively in the internal market, and rogue traders can hide behind borders to target consumers in another Member State. Providing robust consumer protection and informing consumers about their rights will encourage cross-border shopping, with better choice and value.

Indeed, the unjustifiable lack of protection would immediately lead to a failure of confidence in the virtues of the European area. That is why this is one of the flagship initiatives of Community action. However, no matter how much a substantive framework is put forward to regulate the situation of consumers, this lacks mechanisms to apply sanctions. It is therefore necessary to ensure cooperation among the different national authorities, which ensure that the provisions for consumer protection are applied; otherwise they can no longer hold those who knowingly flout these rules to account, as they will simply cross the borders.

Behind this technical title and the lack of fuss, through the updating of the annexes, there is an important challenge: the challenge of providing our national authorities that are responsible for ensuring the application of consumer protection law with increased resources for efficiently detecting violations which harm the collective interests of consumers in cross-border situations, investigating these violations and ensuring that they are suppressed or banned. What we need to do here, therefore, is to organise an efficient and effective fight, at European level, against dishonest economic operators and to prevent certain rather unscrupulous buyers and sellers from escaping legislation, to the competitive detriment of buyers and sellers who respect the law. In this report, to which I contributed and which I supported, we are finally calling on the European Commission to examine, in depth, the functioning of the network known as the Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Network - the EU-wide network of public authorities responsible for enforcing consumer laws in the Member States - and also, after carrying out a broad consultation, to present to us, as soon as possible, and at the latest by the end of 2014, a report accompanied, if necessary, by a legislative proposal.

The regulation of transactions of this kind, given the risk of certain situations of non-payment, required clearing to be carried out by authorised clearing houses, designed as a necessary measure for preventing chain reactions on these markets.

in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document, because the financial crisis has raised concerns regarding the resilience and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market. The G20 agreed that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by the end of 2012 at the latest. OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories. This regulation sets out the conditions for authorising Central Counterparties (CCPs), the criteria for checks to ensure appropriate characteristics for central clearing, and the reporting of derivatives to trade repositories where the aggregate information can be used inter alia for analysis of systemic risk. However, it must be remembered that any regulation should be applied in a carefully measured way.

Labour Euro MPs backed the report today to ensure that the European Union follows up on its G20 commitments to regulate this sector, valued at EUR 425 trillion, and ensure it can no longer threaten the health of the global economy. Regulating OTC derivatives will also help address food and commodity price speculation, which has distorted prices and driven millions into hunger and poverty in recent years.
<P>
By making the market more transparent it will limit the opportunities for market manipulation and the kind of food price spikes seen in 2007/2008. The Council should follow Parliament's lead and allow us to conclude this law and proceed with further necessary proposals, including MiFID and the Market Abuse Directive, which will complete the re-regulation of this sector and comprehensively tackle the practice of gambling with the food on people's plates.

These bodies will have the right to funds from the European Central Bank (ECB), even though these are refused to Member States in debt. This is shameful. I am voting against this report.
<SPEAKER ID="410" NAME="Nuno Melo" LANGUAGE="PT">
The financial products that financial institutions have created over the years have not been properly regulated, and this contributed to the severe financial crisis that was triggered in the past. The absence of a regulatory framework for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives also contributed to the financial crisis and its consequences. In view of this and in order to address concerns about financial stability, in September of last year the Commission presented a proposal to regulate this market. The amendments that have been adopted by Parliament today are principally aimed at improving transparency and managing risk in the OTC derivatives market, so that the same mistakes are not repeated in future, with the severe consequences of which we are all aware.

Taking into account the specificity of the issue, specific targets need to be formulated in more comprehensible language. Effective steps towards public control of over-the-counter derivatives will afford an opportunity to adopt an understandable and transparent programme. I voted in favour.
<SPEAKER ID="410" NAME="Rolandas Paksas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) The over-the-counter derivatives market must remain robust, transparent and competitive. Consequently, it is very important to establish measured regulation, because under-regulation endangers the market, and over-regulation leads to increased costs and even increased prices for the end consumers. Central clearing can itself pose systemic risks, and therefore it is very important for CCPs to have robust risk and default management strategies that do not transfer risk to the taxpayer. I believe that pension funds with a risk-averse profile should be obliged to provide reports and implement risk mitigation techniques for over-the-counter derivative contracts not cleared by a CCP. The clearing obligation should subsist as long as the non-financial counterparty's net positions and exposures in OTC derivative contracts exceed the clearing threshold. Attention should be drawn to the fact that in all cases we must ensure that we avoid disproportionate costs for pensioners. Furthermore, there must be increased powers for European supervisory authorities, giving them the right to impose fines when provisions of this Regulation have been breached.

I voted for the proposal for a regulation as I agree that in order to identify relevant classes of over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives that should be subject to the clearing obligation, the threshold and systemically relevant non-financial counterparties, reliable data is needed. Therefore, for regulatory purposes, I agree that it is important that a uniform OTC derivatives data reporting requirement is established at EU level. Moreover, I agree that a retrospective reporting obligation is needed, to the largest possible extent, for both financial counterparties and non-financial counterparties over the threshold, in order to provide the European Securities and Markets Authority with comparative data. If such retrospective reporting is not feasible for any class of OTC derivatives, I agree that an appropriate justification should be provided to the respective trade repository. I also believe that there should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties with regard to the clearing and reporting obligations. Member States should enforce those penalties in a manner that does not reduce the effectiveness of those rules. I agree that Member States should ensure that the penalties imposed are publicly disclosed and that assessment reports on the effectiveness of existing rules are published at regular intervals.

Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are privately negotiated contracts and any information concerning them is usually only available to the contracting parties.

This model is also followed in Portugal, where, respectively, we have the Bank of Portugal, the Portuguese Insurance and Pension Funds Supervisory Authority and the Portuguese Securities Market Commission, associated with the National Council of Financial Supervisors. In this general context of reconfiguration, it is important to regulate over-the-counter derivatives. The main concern of Community action is now to increase the transparency and supervision of such actions and to avoid creating risks of financial instability. Once again, we are looking at a measure that is aimed at improving the mechanisms for preventing crisis situations.

In its plenary session today, the European Parliament voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation on derivatives. These products have, until now, been traded in the absence of any regulatory framework and in an extremely opaque manner. Although the Council is having trouble finding an agreement on this centrepiece of the post-crisis regulation, Parliament is showing a desire to go forward in accordance with the objectives set in 2009 at the G20 in London and Pittsburgh. In the words of my colleague Mr Canfin, the negotiator of the report for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: 'Parliament's vote marks a big step in the regulation of unregulated areas in the financial sphere. The derivatives market has for too long remained self-regulated. Parliament has decided to give clear support to the European Commission's proposal. With this reform, over-the-counter derivatives, which are currently treated in a bilateral manner, will move towards clearing, which will reduce systemic risk.'
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Licia Ronzulli" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of this report because the European Union must seek to create greater stability and transparency in the financial markets by strengthening the regulation of financial instruments and improving coordination with our major international partners. It is essential to lay down uniform requirements for derivative contracts and for the performance of the activities of central counterparties and trade repositories. With regard to derogations from implementation of the regulation, I believe exemptions should only be allowed following in-depth market investigation and should, in any case, be based on international standards.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Antolín Sánchez Presedo" LANGUAGE="ES">
Derivatives played an important role in the financial crisis. In Pittsburgh the Group of Twenty (G-20) committed to regulate over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, that is to say derivatives outside market regulation, before 2013. It is essential to do so in order to understand and reduce their systemic risk. The broad agreement reached in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is a result of the good work done by Mr Langen and the shadow rapporteurs. The establishment of trade repositories and clearing houses, the implementation of risk management techniques and the strengthening of European supervision will ensure better transparency and security as well as more effective supervision in the area of OTC derivatives. My amendments attempted to enhance the content of the agreement and strengthen stability at a global level, taking into account the United States' Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. I thank the rapporteur for including them, thus ensuring the widening of the regulation's scope, more stringent requirements for clearing houses, the imposition of record-keeping and reporting obligations on financial counterparties, and the clarification of the supervisory authorities' role in the new European architecture. I hope that the deferment of the vote on the legislative resolution will allow an agreement to be reached with the Council, under the Polish Presidency, at first reading.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Amalia Sartori," AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (IT) With regard to the resilience and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, the G20 concluded that all standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by the end of 2012 at the latest. In addition, OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories. I therefore voted in favour of the report because the regulation in question, which promotes the resilience and transparency of derivatives markets, must equally maintain the efficiency of these markets for hedging by end-users - be they financial or non-financial. Maintaining the international nature of this market promotes both these objectives when underpinned by cooperation between supervisors and by convergent international standards.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Catherine Stihler" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I support this proposal, as it is in line with the G20 agreement.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Kay Swinburne" AFFILIATION="ECR">
in writing. - The ECR Group have supported this regulation on the basis that increased transparency through reporting and increased use of central clearing of derivative products globally will help reduce systemic risk in the global financial markets. The package voted upon is in line with G20 commitments and ensures that comparable regulatory measures are being proposed to other major financial jurisdictions. The regulation delivers proportionate responses to different products based on risk (e.g. foreign exchange), considers the needs of end users of such products when used for hedging business activities and takes into account the special circumstances of pension funds.
<P>
We must now ensure that technical details on account segregation, third country recognition and the scope of application are negotiated. Currently, there are products traded on organised trading venues that do not centrally clear - while using public trading venues increases transparency, they do not deal with the problem of counterparty credit risk. I hope that, during the trialogue process, we can ensure that this regulatory gap is filled and that all derivative products will be subject to the same clearing obligation wherever they are traded.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Over-the-counter derivatives lack transparency as they are privately negotiated contracts and any information concerning them is usually only available to the contracting parties. They create a complex web of interdependence, which can make it difficult to identify the nature and level of risks involved. I welcome this regulation as it lays down conditions for mitigating those risks and improving the transparency of derivative contracts. There should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties with regard to the clearing and reporting obligations, and these should be enforced by the Member States in a manner that does not reduce the effectiveness of those rules. Member States should also ensure that the penalties imposed are publicly disclosed and that assessment reports on the effectiveness of existing rules are published at regular intervals. Moreover, it is essential that the right to privacy of individuals is protected when processing personal data, in accordance with Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and of the freedom of movement of such data.
<SPEAKER ID="412" NAME="Thomas Ulmer" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (DE) I have voted in favour of this report. It is essential for us to put in place strict, binding rules and standards for risky financial products in future. I see this as one of the first moves in establishing a better organised and less risky financial sector which may grow more slowly, but will also be significantly more robust. Another decisive issue is the mandatory reporting of derivatives, which will give the supervisory authorities an overview over the financial markets. Trade repositories and a central clearing house will be the first steps towards ensuring transparency.
<SPEAKER ID="413" NAME="Angelika Werthmann" AFFILIATION="NI">
in writing. - (DE) The recent financial crisis clearly highlighted concerns about the resilience and transparency of the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market because of the frequent use of the financial markets by non-financial companies, especially from the commodities and energy sectors, and because of the use of financial instruments for hedging purposes. Now we need to carry out a thorough evaluation of the regulations, otherwise market risks will arise which could have a negative impact on the food commodities and energy generation industries in particular. The systemic risk of OTC derivatives must be kept to a minimum and the process of regulating non-financial companies must be fine-tuned. The proposed amendment aims to make a number of procedures simpler, to prevent 'clearing shocks', to remove barriers to information and to introduce clear criteria for the regulatory decisions.

I am in favour of this proposal as it takes into account the potential risks of economic conglomerates, seeking cooperation among the different authorities responsible in order to ensure convergence of supervisory methods and the clarification of concepts.

The 2008 European Financial Conglomerates Directive (FiCOD) establishes supervision for financial conglomerates, which can include banks, insurance companies, investment companies and asset management companies. The financial crisis has demonstrated the existence of lacunas in this supervision, and the present proposal for a directive thus aims to respond to this. It belongs to the set of measures taken to improve the financial regulation made at European level since the start of the financial crisis. I am pleased at the dynamism shown by the EU in this regard, and I did not hesitate to vote in favour of this proposal for a directive.

in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of the report. Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 (the Financial Conglomerates Directive) introduced supplementary and consolidated supervision of financial groups. The objective of that supplementary supervision was to control the potential risks arising from double gearing (that is, the multiple use of capital) and so-called group risks, in other words, the risk of contagion, management complexity, concentration and conflicts of interest, which could arise when several licences for different financial services are combined. Whilst the EU directives relating to banking activities and insurance activities aim to constitute sufficient capital buffers to protect customers and policyholders, the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FCD) regulates the supplementary supervision of group risks. I welcome the revision of this directive, which will help ensure appropriate supplementary supervision and plug the gaps that have evolved in supplementary supervision, because only European Union legislation can ensure that financial conglomerates operating in more than one Member State are subject to the same requirements and supervision.

It is also vital that the requirements for exemption from supplementary supervision should be applied based on risk, in accordance with these guidelines. This provision is particularly important in the case of larger conglomerates operating at international level.

This proposal is one of a set of measures put forward by the Commission, with the intention of reinforcing the supplementary supervision of the financial institutions of a financial conglomerate.

I would like to highlight in particular the need for supervisors to analyse mixed financial holding companies. It is necessary to ensure that the new European Supervisory Authorities put forward general guidelines on the supervision of financial conglomerates, it is vital to improve the transparency of supervisory activities, just as it is crucial to adopt common criteria on the definition of mixed financial holding companies, which should be included in the supplementary supervision. Finally, I look forward to the Commission's review on the supplementary supervision, which will hopefully be more comprehensive and detailed.

No sector, individual or product can avoid effective regulation and smart supervision. This directive aims to strengthen financial stability. Directive2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate provides the authorities responsible in the financial sector with supplementary powers and tools for the supervision of groups made up of many regulated bodies, which are active in different sectors of the financial markets. Such groups, that is, financial conglomerates, are therefore exposed to risks relating to controlling a group (group risks), which include the risks of contagion, where risks are spread from one end of the group to another; risk concentration, where the same type of risk materialises in various parts of the group at the same time; the complexity of managing many different legal entities; potential conflicts of interest; and the challenge of allocating regulatory capital to all their regulated entities, thereby avoiding the multiple use of capital. I agree that conglomerates should therefore be subject to supplementary supervision as well as supervision on an individual basis.

This report falls within the range of legislation that is currently being discussed in Parliament. Its objective is to monitor the financial system, increase transparency and, more specifically, reduce the risks of derivative markets and short-selling, and strengthen the protection of investors.

This is not to say that, in some cases, the existing situation is not being improved.

In these times of crisis, we have realised how important and fundamental supervision is in trying to anticipate and act in time to avoid damage or in trying to contain it.

For cases where the specific supervisory powers provided by this directive are shown to be insufficient, the supervisory community should develop alternative methods to address and appropriately take into account these risks, preferably through work conducted by the Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities in the forum of the Joint Committee. If participation is the only element that distinguishes a financial conglomerate, I agree that supervisors should be allowed to assess whether the group is exposed to group risks and waive the group from supplementary supervision, if appropriate. Financial conglomerates need to be identified throughout the European Union according to the extent to which they are exposed to group risks.

Short selling is the sale by a physical or legal person of a security which does not belong to that person with the intention of subsequently repurchasing an identical security. This practice, which currently takes place in the majority of financial markets, has since the financial crisis been subject to supervision in many Member States, but, at European level, this has been done in a very haphazard manner, because the EU did not have a legislative framework adapted to short selling. This proposal for a regulation thus aims to make up for this lack.

In 2008, we were on the brink of economic disaster. The financial sector almost led the real economy to the edge of the abyss. After several months of serious depression, and as we have still not emerged from this crisis, it is extremely vital to guard ourselves against the most dangerous practices and the most economically harmful types of speculative behaviour. Clearly, credit default swaps (CDSs) belong to this group. Germany managed to respond rapidly because, several months ago already, it quite simply banned this practice, which involves taking positions purely on the basis of speculation. It is therefore essential to establish clear European rules.

I voted for the proposed regulation as I agree that in order to put an end to the current fragmented situation in which some Member States have taken divergent measures, and to restrict the possibility of this continuing to occur, it is important to address the potential risks arising from short selling and credit default swaps in a harmonised manner. I agree that the requirements to be imposed should address the identified risks, taking into account differences in the Member States and the potential economic impact of the requirements. They should do so without unduly detracting from the benefits that short selling provides to the quality and efficiency of markets by increasing market liquidity, as the short seller sells securities and then later repurchases those securities to cover the short sale, and by allowing investors to act when they believe a security is overvalued, leading therefore to the more efficient pricing of securities.

Europe must learn the lessons from the Greek crisis and reduce the opacity of the financial and banking markets. The use and promotion of financial products which only serve to enrich speculators must be denounced. We must also ban 'naked' credit default swaps (CDSs) on sovereign debt; in other words, the option to buy an insurance security without holding any bonds from the Member State - Greece, for example - and thus to speculate on the bankruptcy of the country without being exposed to any risk. This measure would enable us to eliminate the most speculative types of exchanges, which increase the volatility of the markets and have put Greece, Ireland and Portugal in untenable positions.

Citizens, particularly those from the weakest economies, cannot be made to suffer a second crisis. In order to put an end to the current fragmented situation in which some Member States have taken differing measures, and to restrict the possibility of this continuing to occur, it is important to address the potential risks arising from short selling and credit default swaps in a harmonised manner.

I also believe that measures relating to sovereign debt and sovereign credit default swaps should include greater transparency and restrictions on uncovered short selling, and impose requirements which are proportionate and at the same time avoid an adverse impact on the liquidity of sovereign bond markets and sovereign bond repurchase markets.

This regulation aims to establish emergency measures to restrict or prohibit the short selling of some or all securities.

However, this initiative does not change the essential facts. The fundamental issue remains the same.

Specifically, this short selling instrument has not been eliminated as it should have been. This was essential in order to put an end to this kind of highly speculative financial operation. It is well known that at the height of the financial crisis, in September 2008, the short selling of some or all securities was prohibited in some countries. In several Member States it was, at the very least, restricted through security measures. There was a fear that short selling could worsen the vicious cycle of reducing share prices, particularly the share prices of financial institutions, thus creating systemic risks. Now all of this appears to have been forgotten.

in writing. - (SK) The issue of short selling and credit default swaps is particularly important from the perspective of maintaining financial stability. It is essential that these provisions take the form of a regulation. They impose a direct obligation on private parties to publish information. They also delegate powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This regulation respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised, in particular, in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Transparency is necessary above all for reasons of financial market stability and investor protection. Another item is the proposed ban on so-called naked short selling. The current debt crisis shows how speculators who do not even hold bonds from a Member State of the eurozone, but only speculate on them, can cause entire states to go bankrupt. It is therefore important that only bond holders can engage in covering securities through credit default swaps. Last but not least, we also need to strengthen ESMA's powers. I am quite certain that it should be the Ministers of Finance who take decisions in exceptional situations, and not ESMA.
<SPEAKER ID="423" NAME="Juozas Imbrasas" LANGUAGE="LT">
I welcomed this document, because it gives more powers to the new European supervisory body for the securities market. I believe that we must increase supervision in areas of short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps, in order to avoid economic crises in the future. The measures adopted by Member States were divergent as the European Union lacks a specific legislative framework for dealing with short selling issues. To ensure and improve the functioning of the internal market, in particular the financial markets, and to ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection, it is therefore appropriate to lay down a common framework with regard to the requirements and powers relating to short selling and credit default swaps and to ensure greater coordination and consistency between Member States where measures have to be taken in an exceptional situation. It is necessary to harmonise the framework for short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps, to prevent the creation of obstacles to the internal market, as it is likely that Member States will continue to take divergent measures.

These practices are part of the culture in the financial system which led to the financial crisis and this legislation will help address this.

The US, Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Brazil have already prohibited naked short selling, and so adopting this law would also follow global best practice. Hong Kong has always banned naked short selling, and during the financial crisis their markets performed better and were more stable.

The financial products that financial institutions have created over the years have not been properly regulated, and this contributed to the severe financial crisis that they triggered in the past. The new rules relating to short selling and credit default swaps also aim to create greater transparency, both for the regulating authorities and for the markets, and to allow the regulators to detect more easily the risks of sovereign debt for the market.

It is very important for the European Securities and Markets Authority to properly manage short selling and credit default swaps. In order to achieve this, the authority must be given more powers. It should be noted that credit default swaps in relation to sovereign debt are a particularly effective and efficient means of mitigating risk in a variety of instruments. Consequently, we must define objective market instability criteria. There must be strict control and monitoring of naked short selling and settlement discipline, while market makers should also be exempt from any restrictions or requirements imposed in exceptional situations. All of these measures must be implemented, so that financial markets function smoothly and results are optimised.

On reading the newspapers in recent months, I have noticed that terms like 'short selling' and 'credit default swaps' have unfortunately become part of everyday language, and not for the right reasons. These are the instruments through which the harmful speculation that does nothing but damage to our countries and people has been and is still being carried on. That is why it is important to introduce regulation, but it must be thorough and not just a by-product of the crisis. I therefore agree that it is a case of continuing with the trialogue to try to obtain a balanced text on which people can agree but which does not demonise these practices. The original text of the proposal was rather restrictive and would actually have stopped this kind of activity. Thanks to a series of amendments, the text that was adopted in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is much more balanced. At the moment the only point arousing concern is Article 12, which provides for restrictions on naked or uncovered short sales (sales not covered by shares borrowed or taken as collateral), as well as credit debt swaps. I truly hope that a balanced mutual agreement can be reached during the trialogue.

I agree that the requirements to be imposed should address the identified risks, taking into account differences in the Member States and the potential economic impact of the requirements. They should do so without unduly detracting from the benefits that short selling provides to the quality and efficiency of markets by increasing market liquidity, as the short seller sells securities and then later repurchases those securities to cover the short sale, and by allowing investors to act when they believe a security is overvalued, leading therefore to the more efficient pricing of securities. I agree that it is necessary to harmonise the framework for short selling and certain aspects of credit default swaps, to prevent the creation of obstacles to the internal market, as it is likely that Member States will continue to take differing measures.

Short selling and credit default swaps are a speculative practice, which does not benefit the economy in any way, since they encourage betting on countries' noncompliance. The bigger the bets, the greater the pressure on the country and, as a consequence, the greater the risk. This proposal for a regulation aims to restrict and, in some situations, prohibit these practices, in particular where sovereign debt securities are concerned, so as to control market speculation. Although I believe that a more restrictive regulation of these speculative activities is necessary, the amended proposed regulation constitutes a first step in this direction, which is why I voted for this report.

Financial speculation has caused untold damage to the exchequers of those very states which scrambled to save the financial sector from the brink of destruction, at the expense of essential public services and social provision on which our citizens' well-being depends. Parliament is sending a very clear message to the Council ahead of the negotiations to come on this piece of legislation: if investors do not own sovereign bonds, or assets whose value is tied to them, they should not be able to seek profit from defaults on debt they do not own by trading in sovereign credit default swaps. Such speculative practices have no real economic utility, and they encourage betting on the failure of states to fulfil their obligations. I also welcome the proposed requirement that naked shorting be allowed only when, at the end of the trading day, the securities meant to be sold have at least been located and reserved.

During the financial crisis it was necessary, in a number of Member States, to restrict or ban the short selling of some or even all securities. It then became well known that systemic risks could exist, and to prevent this Parliament and the Council aimed to go ahead with regulation of short selling and some aspects of credit default swaps (CDS). As such, a regulation seems to be the most appropriate solution, in that it offers the regulation with the most guarantees of certainty and security, whilst also enabling more concerted action by the Member States. In the same way, this will also guarantee that it will be applied under the aegis of the European Supervisory Authority (ESA). This is another solution aimed at providing Europe with mechanisms suitable for satisfying its future objectives.

My colleague Mr Canfin, Parliament's rapporteur, responds as follows: 'Parliament has just demonstrated to the Council that it is determined to put an end to speculation on sovereign debt in Europe. Every day, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area demonstrates the need for strict supervision of speculation on the debt of Member States. Europe can no longer allow speculators to enrich themselves on the back of their fellow citizens who are called on to bail out the coffers of Member States that are forced into bankruptcy. With the report voted on today in plenary, it would no longer be possible for a hedge fund to buy Greek CDSs without holding bonds from Greece and thus to speculate on the bankruptcy of the country. In addition to banning sovereign CDSs, Parliament has clearly reaffirmed its desire for stricter supervision when it comes to the naked short selling of securities. The desire expressed by Parliament for the European Securities and Markets Agency (ESMA) to play a greater role in this regulation is also fulfilled.'

in writing. - (NL) The European Parliament today drew clear conclusions on lessons to learn from the global credit crisis and the European debt crisis. The House voted in favour of banning naked credit default swaps (CDSs) on government bonds and of keeping naked short selling in check.
<P>
Credit default swaps act as insurance for bondholders against payment problems on the part of governments and businesses. These derivatives are, however, also sold by speculators who do not hold any bonds themselves. Anyone who holds credit default swaps without an underlying interest is positioned to gain in the event of panic on the financial markets. This is because, whenever doubt arises about the ability of a country to pay off its debts, these CDSs increase in value. The speculation on CDSs did not cause the crisis relating to the debts of Greece and other countries in the euro area, but it did greatly aggravate it. Speculators should only be permitted to buy Greek CDSs if they really do hold Greek government bonds. That would make it more difficult to gamble on Greece going bankrupt.
<P>
Speculators on the financial markets find it too easy to profit from this kind of perverse trading, while European taxpayers pay the price. I am thus pleased that this House adopted the proposal to prohibit the holding of naked CDSs on government bonds.

The 1997 Investor Compensation Scheme Directive allows customers who have received services from an investment company to receive compensation under certain circumstances, when the company is unable to pay the money or the financial instruments that it holds on behalf of the customer. Nevertheless, this directive leaves a lot of freedom to the Member States. The present proposal thus aims to improve the functioning of these compensation systems by clarifying their scope of application and by taking into account the financial crisis and the subsequent regulatory measures adopted by the EU.

Directive 97/9/EC on Investor Compensation Schemes (ICSD) was adopted in 1997 to complement the Investment Services Directive, which was later replaced by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID). Ten years since the ICSD entered into force, and against the backdrop of the financial crisis, there is a need to review the functioning of the ICSD, because the Commission has received numerous complaints from investors about the application of this directive, which has sometimes led to investors experiencing very significant losses. Furthermore, this review must consider the objective set at G20 level of addressing any loopholes in the regulatory and supervisory system and the objective of restoring investor confidence in the financial system. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently fulfilled by the Member States, because the current EU framework only provides for some minimum harmonisation principles, leaving it up to Member States to develop it further. However, problems encountered in some Member States demonstrate that additional and notably more extensive harmonisation at EU level is necessary in order to ensure that the objectives of the directive are fulfilled within the EU. This directive's amendments will improve the proper functioning of a single market for investment services, will increase investor protection and investor confidence in the European Union and will establish common rules to ensure a degree of harmonisation in the funding of the schemes and daily practice.

It is crucial to recover and reinforce consumer protection using common EU-level rules, not least as regards financing systems at national level, as well as to ensure that these systems operate as a mutual insurance mechanism.

The purpose of this proposal is to protect private investors so that they can save with confidence. Compensation is a last resort and should be the same for everyone. Protection of investors means protection of consumers. Prevention mechanisms are always preferable.

This requires the Member States to encourage an institutionalised dialogue between consumer protectors, authorities, supervisory authorities and investor compensation schemes to prevent further compensation cases. I would argue that coverage levels for guaranteeing deposits should be changed to EUR 100 000 instead of the EUR 50 000 proposed by the Commission. In order to be able to recover the funds paid for compensation, schemes making payments to compensate investors for failure of a depositary or a third party should have the right of subrogation to the rights of the investor or investment firm in liquidation proceedings for amounts equal to their payments.

The financial crisis has destabilised a whole series of high-risk financial products, which in some cases were sold to investors as being safe places to put their money. A number of court cases have been going on in this area for some time. For example, despite being aware that this was inadvisable, JPMorgan is alleged to have recommended that investors buy retail mortgage-backed securities when the prices on the property market had long since stopped rising. In addition, JPMorgan is said to have failed to tell investors that a hedge fund was involved, which was betting on the collapse of the securities. The investors, including the pension fund of the carmaker General Motors, lost almost all their investments. The losses made by pension funds as a result of speculation represent a major problem in this respect. Some examples from an Austrian perspective include the millions of euros lost by the Vienna Chamber of Commerce and the joint pension fund of the Austrian Chambers of Commerce, together with cases where legally acquired occupational pension rights were transferred to pension funds by means of highly risky contracts without the knowledge or consent of those affected. Against better judgment, these funds promised tax assessment earnings at unrealistically high levels. This report has many positive features, but it pays no attention at all to this problem, which is equivalent to the failure of the second pillar of the pension system. For this reason, I have abstained from voting.

I believe it is vital to restore confidence in investment and I think we are going in the right direction with this report.
<P>
An investor needs maximum protection against the risk that the firm holding his or her deposits might collapse. A higher guaranteed compensation threshold, with adequate funding commensurate to the risk, is therefore welcome. Harmonisation at European level is also necessary to prevent and avoid market distortion. In addition, cross-border investments should be allowed to enjoy the same protection as national investments.
<P>
Market security and stability are essential for restoring consumer confidence, and the work of the new European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) can and must contribute to this. I therefore hope that this set of measures proves effective at reviving investment and with it the whole European economy.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Rolandas Paksas" LANGUAGE="LT">
The European single market must function harmoniously and we must constantly promote its integration and strengthen consumer protection. Consumers and depositaries must be sure that they are operating in a stable financial environment. We must establish an efficient compensation scheme and stronger common rules concerning funding at national level. It is crucial for investors with cross-border investments to enjoy the same level of protection in all Member States. I agree with the proposal that the level of compensation should be increased to EUR 100 000. Furthermore, in cases where an investment firm or a third party is in a state of insolvency, it is very important to facilitate the return of investors' financial instruments. In order to strengthen investor protection, ensuring a level playing field for investors, we must above all improve the single European market for financial services and harmonise EU legislation. It is necessary to put forward long-term robust financing principles for investor compensation schemes, and to reduce the contributions to the schemes so that they would be regarded as mutual insurance mechanisms, rather than taxes or payments of a fiscal nature.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Alfredo Pallone" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Schmidt. The proposal for a directive, which is based on the one on deposit guarantee schemes for the banks, amends the scheme for compensating investors in the event that intermediaries (investment firms and also credit institutions) become insolvent, by establishing a series of rules on sums guaranteed and contribution schemes. I regret that the distance between our positions means that agreement could not be reached at first reading, and so we now have to move on to a difficult second reading. I believe this sector too needs suitable regulation, harmonised throughout Europe, as soon as possible.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I voted for the resolution because I agree that Member States should encourage an institutionalised dialogue between consumer protectors, authorities, supervisory authorities and investor compensation schemes to prevent further compensation cases. I agree that Member States should establish a dialogue framework to detect problems at an early stage and report problems such as dysfunctional market practices, conspicuous providers, products or company structures to supervision and investor compensation schemes. I also agree that the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) should be delegated to the Commission in respect of the determination of the method to calculate the target fund level to be established by the schemes and to modify this target fund level, the percentage of the determined ceiling of the funds available for lending between national compensation schemes, and the procedure for dealing with investors' claims. Furthermore, I agree that the power to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 of the TFEU should be delegated to the Commission, in respect of amendments to the percentage of funds available for lending, taking into account the developments in the financial markets.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
Defence of financial stability has been a constant in recent EU activity. This requires investors to have confidence that the market will operate normally. Therefore, a system of coverage or guarantees of investments, up to a given value, could prove extremely important in attracting smaller-scale consumers. Nevertheless, national planning should be linked to EU-level planning: therefore, when a higher level of protection is being offered at national level than is being provided for at Union level, this should take precedence, since it offers consumers a higher level of protection. This is another step in overcoming the situation through which Europe is currently struggling.

Today, during the part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, we voted on the report on investor compensation schemes.

The three main objectives of the report are to: increase consumer protection through higher coverage; improve the European single market for financial services and harmonise investor compensation schemes in the Union; and put forward long-term, robust financing principles for investor compensation schemes.
<P>
The new EU legislation should increase the harmonisation and integration of the European single market, strengthen consumer protection, create more confidence among consumers and depositors and thereby enhance financial stability.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - In favour. The new EU legislation should increase the harmonisation and integration of the Single European market, strengthen consumer protection and create more confidence for consumers and depositors and enhance financial stability. The rapporteur has suggested three main objectives: a. to increase consumer protection through a higher coverage; b. to improve the single European market for financial services and create European harmonisation of investor compensation schemes in the Union; c. to put forward long term robust financing principles for investor compensation schemes.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Licia Ronzulli" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted for this report because I believe that the amendments to the directive on investor compensation schemes must be designed to improve consumer protection, with a view to greater harmonisation of the European single market.
<P>
Full harmonisation of the amount of compensation is preferable to minimum harmonisation, since it increases consumer protection, gives investors stronger protection and creates no risk of arbitrage between Member States. Harmonisation of the financing of compensation schemes is welcome, provided the target fund level is not too high. The funds in fact should cover cases of mismanagement and fraud in the deposited securities.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Amalia Sartori," LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the directive amending the previous directive on investor-compensation schemes, because I believe it is essential to improve consumer protection by means of improved coverage, faster payouts and more efficient protection schemes. In addition, the European single market for financial services must be made more functional and investor compensation schemes in the Union must be harmonised. Long-term, robust financing principles for investor compensation schemes must also be put forward.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Catherine Stihler" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I support this legislation, because I think that it is of vital importance to ensure that private investors are better protected against fraudulent and defaulting investment firms.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Investors may not be aware of lacking or limited authorisations of investment firms, so it is important to protect them in situations in which investment firms act without or in breach of their authorisation, notably by holding client assets or providing services to a particular type of client without or contrary to the conditions of their authorisation. I therefore agree that schemes should cover clients' assets which are de facto held by investment firms in connection with any investment business. In order to be able to recover the funds paid for compensation, schemes making payments to compensate investors for failure of a depositary or a third party should have the right of subrogation to the rights of the investor or investment firm in liquidation proceedings for amounts equal to their payments. I also agree that this directive should not be intended to diminish the responsibility of investment firms for recovering assets from a depositary or custodian entity, and I voted for the document's proposals.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Derek Vaughan" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I voted in favour of this report as I feel that ordinary investors need to know that they are protected when making decisions on where to invest for their future. MEPs voted for compensation against fraudulent and defaulting investment firms, and added 'bad advice' as grounds for claiming compensation. The rules would also enable local authorities and NGOs, as well as private individuals, to file compensation claims.
<P>
More protection for investors should be welcomed, but calls to increase the level of protection from EUR 50 000 to EUR 100 000 were unfortunately defeated, as once again we see the right-wing voting to protect their chums in the City, and not investors in Wales.

in writing. - (DE) The revision of Directive 97/9/EC and the supplementary directive on securities services, which were adopted in 1997 and replaced by the Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), is the result of numerous complaints by investors who have made significant losses. The objective is to restore the confidence of investors in the financial system. The proposal aims to improve the internal market for securities services, increase the protection available for investors and restore their trust. A better compensation scheme for investors will be put in place and loopholes in the existing regulation system will be closed. In addition, the differences between the protection available to the customers of brokerage firms and to bank investors will be removed. The proposal is based on the principle of proportionality. All the solutions will be evaluated to ensure their cost-effectiveness and the special features of the markets in the individual Member States will be taken into consideration.

I voted for the text presented by Mr Schmidt, which proposes further convergence between European compensation schemes, specifically by improving consumer protection through higher levels of coverage, harmonising investor compensation schemes in the Union and establishing the financing principles for investor compensation schemes.
<P>
The text voted on would, in effect, reduce the discretionary power of Member States and provide more guarantees of effective protection for European consumers. Such harmonisation would not only improve the level of protection, it would also affect the way schemes are funded and members' contributions are calculated.

in writing. - (FR) The European Commission has proposed to grant Member States the right to ban genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on any grounds, except for grounds relating to health or the environment, which had to be exclusively assessed by the European Food Safety Authority. Having committed itself to guaranteeing a firmer legal basis in the context of international trade rules, Parliament insisted that the Member States should be able to provide supplementary environmental grounds. I think that all the Member States must take measures to prevent the contamination of GMOs in conventional or organic farming and to ensure that those behind such incidents are held responsible financially.
<P>
That is why I voted for this report, which I think is a balanced one. If the Council manages to find a common position, it will permit Member States and regions not to cultivate GMOs if they do not wish to do so.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Luís Paulo Alves" LANGUAGE="PT">
In line with the principle of subsidiarity, this proposal provides for it being the Member States that establish measures to limit or even ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territories, based not just on environmental impact and maintaining biodiversity, but also on socio-economic issues. For its part, the policy advocated by the European Union hopes to prevent the various effects of GMOs on animal and human health. I am therefore abstaining because of the possible contradictions present in these guidelines.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Charalampos Angourakis" LANGUAGE="EL">
The report amending the directive as regards the possibility for the Member States to restrict GMOs in their territory not only fails to guarantee any protection for public health and the environment from the serious repercussions of the spread of modified foods; in essence it legalises them. Any minor improvements made by the report to the European Commission's initial proposal do not get to the heart of the problem, namely the fact that the Member States cannot ban the trade in modified organisms in their territory. Thus, it is impossible to afford any protection to workers, even in states which have banned GMO crops in their territory. It is no coincidence that, for the last 10 years, despite the provisions in this particular directive, the European Commission has not carried out a study into the impact of GMOs on health and the environment, even though a series of studies illustrating their disastrous consequences has been published.
<P>
The European Commission and the European Parliament are turning their backs, so as not to affect the profits of the three monopoly groups plundering the GMO market and promoting their uncontrolled spread. The only way to protect public health and the environment from the painful consequences of GMOs is to introduce a general and complete ban both on GM crops and on the trade in them.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Sophie Auconie" LANGUAGE="FR">
The cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) regularly arouses passions, unfortunately sometimes without sufficient appeal to reason. I used my vote to call for decisions on the authorisation or prohibition of GMO cultivation to continue, as far as possible, to be taken at European level, so that the single market does not fall apart and so that we do not create distortions of competition among European farmers. If the growing of a particular GMO is bad for Sweden, it is also bad for France. I therefore think it is essential to strengthen the role of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in order to ensure optimal food safety and environmental safety throughout the continent. I recognise, however, that certain criteria, such as public policy, which is recognised within the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and is thus legally applicable, must be able to be used by the Member States to restrict or prohibit, on a case-by-case basis, the cultivation of certain GMOs which pose particular difficulties in certain Member States.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Jean-Luc Bennahmias" LANGUAGE="FR">
It is euphemistic to say that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are controversial in Europe. While several Member States, including France, are using their escape clause to refuse to cultivate certain GMOs, at the moment the Member States have very little room for manoeuvre, and, because of unanimity, or even majority, decisions are regularly blocked in the Council. The idea of this directive is therefore to reintroduce a degree of freedom for Member States: they will be able to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs within their territory. We have adopted Mrs Le Page's report by a very large majority, a report which was the result of long negotiations, and which I think represents a balanced compromise. This is a difficult exercise, because we are in a single market, supposedly without barriers. The report therefore strives to find a balance between the EU's system of authorisation and the freedom of the Member States to respond to their specific national or local problems. It must be emphasised, however, that the Member States will no longer be able to act as they see fit: a list of grounds has been drawn up which will serve as a basis for justifying the restriction or prohibition of the cultivation of GMOs. Among the possible grounds given are environmental and socio-economic impacts, as well as land use and town and country planning.
<SPEAKER ID="443" NAME="Antonio Cancian" LANGUAGE="IT">
The debate has been extensive and wide-ranging, with different positions that have often been difficult to reconcile.
<P>
I voted for the work by the rapporteur because it took into due consideration the concerns about the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) expressed by Member States. In particular, I believe it is important that the possibility for the Member States to prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs in their territory should remain. Each Member State will be able to introduce specific bans going beyond considerations relating to human health protection and the environment or the effective functioning of the internal market, which are already guaranteed to the highest level on a European basis.
<P>
The need for more consistent legislation balanced between the European GMO authorisation system and requests from Member States when independently deciding how to transpose the legislation has led to some difficulties in achieving a common position. The principle of subsidiarity remains in place, in the event that a Member State should decide to apply legislation that is stricter than the European standards.
<P>
It is vital that research on GMOs should not be stopped. The conditio sine qua non is that maximum transparency must be guaranteed in the information provided to consumers, through the traceability of genetically modified (GM) products.
<SPEAKER ID="443" NAME="Nikolaos Chountis" LANGUAGE="EL">
Mr Dali has presented an unacceptable proposal that resembles a Trojan Horse. Although he allows the Member States to ban approved GM crops in all or part of their territory, they cannot invoke grounds relating to health and environmental risks. Thus, on the one hand, the Commission is disregarding the clear message sent to it by those Member States that have declared themselves no-GMO zones and, on the other hand, it shows no respect for the will of its citizens, a large proportion of whom are against GMOs.
<P>
I voted in favour of the Lepage report, because it goes some way towards strengthening and improving the Commission proposal, by plugging the gaps in it and, at the same time, making the European Parliament a strong player in the negotiations that are bound to follow. Thanks to the approved report, environmental protection, biodiversity, natural and agricultural characteristics in particular, respect for public opinion, compulsory measures to combat contamination and socio-economic reasons are now criteria for national bans on the cultivation of GMOs. The proposal will also be governed by the 'polluter pays' principle and the principle of risk prevention, thanks to the amendment tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green left, which I supported and which was approved.
<SPEAKER ID="443" NAME="Corina Creţu" LANGUAGE="RO">
I voted for the proposal amending Directive 2001/18/EC as regards the possibility for Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory. The directive and Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed establish a very tight framework which, if correctly enforced, will offer a high level of protection for human life and health, animal health and welfare, the environment and consumer interests, while ensuring the efficient functioning of the internal market. The directive only allows GMOs to be placed on the market if a specific environmental risk assessment has been carried out. Annex II, which establishes the principles applicable to the environmental risk assessment, requires that direct and indirect immediate and delayed effects be taken into account, as well as an analysis carried out of the cumulative long-term effects on flora and fauna, soil fertility, soil degradation of organic material, the feed/food chain, biological diversity, animal health and resistance problems in relation to antibiotics.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations. We need an overall solution which gives consumers and farmers freedom of choice, supports the principle of proportionality and, at long last, also provides a practical solution to the question of coexistence.

The cultivation or non-cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) must remain within the competence of the Member States. That is the message that Parliament has just reiterated to the Council and the Commission. The diversity of ecosystems and agricultural practices in Europe, as well as the insufficient amount of reliable data on local impacts, resistance to pesticides, the maintenance of biodiversity, and the risks of contamination of traditional or organic farming that cannot be controlled practically, are sufficient justifications for Member States to be able to legitimately prohibit the cultivation of GMOs within their territory. At a time when we have been suffering successive hygiene crises, it is our duty to ensure high-quality food for all of our citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="445" NAME="Anne Delvaux" LANGUAGE="FR">
I am pleased at the vote on Mrs Lepage's report, which was submitted to MEPs today at first reading, because it aims to bring legal security to Member States who wish to restrict or to prohibit genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within their territory. This report gives them a large range of arguments to legitimise their decision, and it goes further than the initial proposal by the European Commission, which, as we know, has recently taken very favourable positions with regard to GMOs.
<P>
On this subject, I asked Commissioner Dalli why existing legislation on this matter - namely, the Directive 2001/18/CE, which includes numerous legal and scientific guarantees - had still not been applied. Why have the recommendations contained in the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development from December 2008, for example in terms of enhancing Community scientific evaluations, remained a dead letter to this day? In my opinion, the guarantee of an independent and absolute scientific evaluation is an essential precondition for the confidence of citizens and the Member States. In a general sense, I truly consider today's vote to be a victory for citizens, because we should not forget that, according to the last Eurobarometer poll in October 2010, 61% of Europeans remain opposed to the growing of GMOs.
<SPEAKER ID="446" NAME="Diane Dodds" AFFILIATION="NI">
in writing. - While I agree with the principles of the report and the need for Member States to maintain control in relation to approval of the cultivation of GMOs, it is important that we do not create a dysfunctional single market for produce within the EU. The draft report does not deal with the dysfunctional legislative process for GM cultivation or the authorisation process for new technologies. A science-led approach is needed but it is important that both farmers' and consumers' concerns are addressed. Research and innovation in agriculture is important for the survival of the industry, the EU must not be left behind. Those who would like to remain GMO-free must also be respected; GMO contamination is a worry which must be addressed. Agriculture must evolve, be more sustainable and find more efficient ways to use expensive inputs; this will involve embracing new technology. In moving to embrace new technology we must be confident the market is willing to purchase it.

<P>
Therefore, I welcome the fact that we are adopting a report today which makes a ban on GMOs possible and which strengthens consumers' rights. Once again we are reinforcing consumers' rights more effectively than the Member States have done.
<P>
The European Parliament was responsible for introducing the mandatory labelling of GMOs last year, not the Council of Ministers.

This report makes it possible for Member States to impose a ban on GMOs, because of the fear of pesticide resistance, for example.

The purpose of this Commission proposal is to authorise the Member States to limit or completely ban the cultivation of any genetically modified organisms (GMOs) that may be authorised at Union level in all or part of their territory. These bans or limitations will have other foundations than those covered by the health and environmental risk assessments that are part of the EU authorisation process. This proposal does not change the Union's current legal framework relating to existing authorisations for cultivation of GMOs, and is limited to providing a legal framework for cases of Member States that are already not applying these same authorisations, banning the cultivation of GMOs in their territory.

This report stresses the need for a more preventative and cautious attitude as regards cultivating genetically modified organisms (GMOs), whilst also emphasising the importance of protecting the environment, as well as of defending traditional farming, and small and medium-sized farmers. It also takes into account the diversity of the European Union, and the need to make the Member States fully able to intervene in the particular characteristics of their territories and agricultural activities.

For our part, we continue to advocate an effective application of the precautionary principle and the withdrawal of the GMO species already introduced, so defending health, the environment and farmers.

in writing. - (SK) The European Parliament and Council Directive of 12 March 2001 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), together with the European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of 22 March 2003 on genetically modified food and feed, establish a very strict framework which should, if applied correctly, ensure a high level of protection for human life and health, the health and decent living conditions of animals, environmental protection and the interests of consumers, while also securing the proper functioning of the internal market. The directive does not permit GMOs to be marketed unless a special environmental risk assessment is carried out. The requirements of the directive in the area of risk assessment are not complied with, however, and these shortcomings in its implementation explain the opposition in many Member States to the cultivation of GMOs on their territory. It should be noted that the issue of cultivating and releasing transgenic plants on a territory has to be distinguished from permits for marketing and consumption, as well as the free movement of goods and products, to which this text does not apply. In addition to from this, GMO cultivation should not result in additional costs for conventional or organic agriculture. We must therefore stipulate that Member States are obliged to adopt measures to prevent GMOs being present in other products.
<SPEAKER ID="448" NAME="Elisabetta Gardini" LANGUAGE="IT">
With today's vote the European Parliament has allowed Member States to decide independently whether to authorise or prohibit genetically modified (GM) crops in their territory based on an examination of the possible social and environmental repercussions.
<P>
Everyone is aware that European citizens continue to have a deep-seated mistrust of genetically modified products. According to research carried out by Eurobarometer in 2010, approximately 61% of Europeans feel uneasy about GM products, and over 53% think that they are harmful to their health. This lack of faith within public opinion with regard to these agricultural products cannot be ignored, while at the same time the local agricultural traditions rooted within each Member State cannot be forgotten.
<P>
In fact, it is precisely in taking these elements into account that shows that the resolution should not be seen as an endorsement of GM products, but as an acknowledgement of greater national freedom to create an agricultural policy that is best suited to the territory, the local traditions and the sensitivities of the citizens living there. I hope that this vote will be the beginning of a debate at all levels on the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) within the European Union.
<SPEAKER ID="449" NAME="Robert Goebbels" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted against the Lepage report because it does not aim in any way to enshrine the free choice of the Member States to authorise or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), but instead multiplies the barriers for those countries which, like a growing section of the rest of the world, want to benefit from the advantages of GMOs. Fourteen million farmers have been growing GMOs for years without any negative impact on human or animal health or on the environment. In Europe, on the other hand, we cultivate fears, while importing massive amounts of genetically modified soya and corn to feed our livestock. That has, quite clearly, had no consequences for animals and humans, except that we are preventing our agriculture from adopting techniques that would allow us to reduce the usage of pesticides, fertilisers and other added chemicals.
<SPEAKER ID="449" NAME="Nathalie Griesbeck" LANGUAGE="FR">
Within the European Union, the debate on authorising or prohibiting the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has raged for several years. With the adoption of this report by a large majority, we wanted to bring more clarity to this debate. From now on, the Member States will be able to choose as they see fit in relation to GMOs. They will be able to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in a simpler way than at present. The Member States will have the option to provide environmental grounds such as the maintenance of biodiversity, a lack of data or resistance to pesticides. Overall, I voted for this report simply because it offers clearer guidance on what can or cannot be tolerated with regard to the growing of GMOs in the European Union. We have sent a strong message to the Council to translate these aspirations into action.

I supported the amended Lepage report, which seeks to strengthen the rules at European level by allowing Member States who do not wish to use genetically modified seeds to present clear and practical arguments for doing so. I agree with the report's analysis, namely that the Commission's initial proposal was actually too vague and could be taken to mean that genetically modified organisms could be rejected on purely ethical grounds, but not for environmental or health reasons. This was not acceptable. The aim here is to send a signal to the Member States and force them, at long last, to accept their responsibilities on this subject. In addition, the report gives an indication of what should be included in the Commission's revised text, which it is due to present in 2012.

According to the latest Eurobarometer survey on this issue published in October 2010, 61% of Europeans consider that GM food makes them feel uneasy, and the same proportion disagree with the idea that the development of GM food should be encouraged. Only 21% agree (as opposed to the 58% who disagree) with the statement that GM food is safe for future generations. In no country was there a majority of respondents who agreed with the statement that GM food is good for the national economy. Furthermore, there is still insufficient information and reliable scientific evidence for us to state that genetically modified products and foods derived from them do not pose any danger to our environment or human health.
<SPEAKER ID="451" NAME="Agnès Le Brun" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation to allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in part or all of their territory. This is a good compromise between an outright ban, which would be difficult to achieve, and an authorisation that would prevent Member States who wanted to apply the precautionary principle from doing so. The text adopted on Tuesday will therefore give Member States the freedom to choose and, if they so wish, to prohibit GMO crops for reasons other than health or environmental concerns. Parliament has amended the European Commission's proposal by calling on Member States to strengthen measures to avoid contamination of conventional or organic farm produce by GMO crops. It also requires Member States to establish a system of financial liability in which the polluter has to pay for any contamination.

<SPEAKER ID="453" NAME="Clemente Mastella" LANGUAGE="IT">
Current European legislation on genetically modified (GM) food and feed establishes a very tight framework which, if correctly enforced, should offer a high level of protection of human life and health, animal welfare, the environment and consumer interests, whilst ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market.
<P>
The requirements in the directive regarding risk assessment are not being observed, and these shortcomings explain the opposition encountered in several Member States to the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on their territory. We believe there should be a strengthening of environmental assessment and of monitoring arrangements, and that Member States should be given greater powers where there is a lack of relevant information about the impact on their national territory.
<P>
The high level of protection in the field of health and the environment can only be achieved if all the necessary studies on the receiving environment and the conditions in the monitoring plans are effectively at the disposal of the Member States. The measures taken by Member States should apply to a given GMO or, as the case may be, to a group of GMOs with similar characteristics, rather than to all GMOs. These measures should always be substantiated according to the 'scientific method' and justified by any cases of cross-border contamination.
<SPEAKER ID="454" NAME="Marisa Matias" LANGUAGE="PT">
The measures provided for in this report are founded on an extensive list of the potential consequences - properly backed up - of the deliberate release or the placing on the market of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), and warns of many of their dangers. As such, the report mentions that it is founded on the risk of increased pesticide resistance in harmful species, on the invasion of GMOs or their possible crossing with cultivated domestic or wild plants, and on the impact of changes in agricultural practices.
<P>
It is also based on developing agricultural practices that provide better potential for reconciling production with the sustainability of ecosystems, on maintaining biodiversity, on the high cost or impossibility of applying coexistence measures, on protecting the diversity of agricultural production, and on guaranteeing seed purity. It also warns of a lack of adequate data. I voted for the report because it is based on stating the real dangers of GMO use.

in writing. - EU Member States should have the flexibility to ban or restrict the cultivation of genetically modified crops and should be able to cite environmental motives for doing so. The Commission had proposed to grant EU Member States the right to ban crops on all but health or environmental grounds, which were to be solely assessed by the European Food Safety Authority.
<P>
However, Parliament, committed to ensuring a firmer legal basis in the context of international trade rules, insisted that Member States should not be prevented from stating additional environmental grounds. These could include pesticide resistance, biodiversity preservation or a lack of data on potential negative consequences on the environment, as well as socio-economic impacts in cases where contamination risks to conventional or organic agriculture cannot practicably be managed.
<SPEAKER ID="456" NAME="Jean-Luc Mélenchon" LANGUAGE="FR">
This report is welcome in that it would allow Member States to prohibit genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory and to require a 'GMO-free' label. However, more is needed. I am calling for a European moratorium on GMOs until they have been proven to be harmless. It should be possible for any Member State to ban the free circulation of GMO products as proposed in this report if it so wishes.
<SPEAKER ID="456" NAME="Nuno Melo" LANGUAGE="PT">
I agree that the Member States should be able to limit or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory, in line with this agreement that has just been adopted. I also agree with Parliament's proposed amendments increasing measures designed to ban or limit the cultivation of GMOs in part or all of a Member State's territory. We should also base going ahead with such bans on local or regional environmental reasons, and on their socio-economic impact. The Member States should also be able, when they choose, to take into account reasons relating to socio-economic impacts, such as the impracticality or high cost of coexistence measures and the risk of contaminating conventional or organic farming with GMOs.
<SPEAKER ID="457" NAME="Louis Michel" LANGUAGE="FR">
I welcome Mrs Lepage's report. She has been able to define specific criteria for opting out. The report successfully improves legal certainty and eliminates the risk of legal disputes. It does not alter the centralised European Food Safety Agency authorisation process in any way, but does recognise that Member States are entitled to carry out additional national assessments or add to the programme of risk management measures.
<P>
Although the report does not seek to decide whether Europe should be for or against the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), I would nonetheless like to emphasise that we cannot oppose research into and development of new technologies. I am pleased, therefore, to note that the report includes the possibility of providing the financial resources necessary for scientific research. The Union's credibility in terms of research and development depends on this, as does European companies' competitiveness on the world stage, with 64 million hectares of GMO crops in the United States and 21 million hectares in India and Canada.
<SPEAKER ID="458" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
I have voted in favour of the proposal which allows EU Member States to decide independently about whether to restrict or ban genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in future. The report represents a success for those Member States whose citizens are very health-conscious and opposed to genetic engineering. Around 20% of the seed sold on the global market is genetically modified. It is not yet clear whether farmers who plant genetically modified seeds really use less pesticides, which is the argument always put forward by the supporters of genetic engineering. The fact that the seed can only be used for one year and, therefore, that artificial dependencies are being created also gives cause for concern. Genetic engineering remains an area where the short- and long-term consequences have not yet been made clear. Critics of genetic engineering, for example, suspect that there is a connection between the rapid increase in allergic reactions over recent years and genetically modified foods. In addition to allergies, opponents fear a range of other side effects may be caused, including kidney and liver damage. Another important issue concerns the interaction between genetically modified crops, pesticides, radioactive radiation and other chemicals, which has not yet been adequately investigated.
<SPEAKER ID="458" NAME="Claudio Morganti" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of this report, because it is fully in line with our approach to the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
<P>
I consider that it is fundamental for Member States to have the freedom to decide whether or not to cultivate these organisms, based on the measures they deem most appropriate. There may be justifiable grounds of an environmental, socio-economic or geographical-territorial nature that can, and must, allow Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs.
<P>
I would not want the freedom to cultivate GMOs granted by the European Union in this sector to transform itself into a forced obligation and therefore not to allow the correct distinctions to be made. I do not want our territories and traditions, with their globally recognised examples of agricultural excellence, to be destroyed by the imprudent use of artificially modified substances and organisms which have nothing to do with everything nature already offers us in abundance.
<SPEAKER ID="459" NAME="Cristiana Muscardini" LANGUAGE="IT">
I appreciate the work carried out by Mrs Lepage, and I believe it is essential for Member States to increase the controls on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the potential environmental impact of such products on the various national ecosystems.
<P>
However, the Commission must be required to perform such monitoring, which cannot be left to the individual national authorities. We cannot allow genetically modified (GM) products such as Mon 810 maize to be imported or authorised only in some Member States, and then find they are part of our diet. I therefore call for greater coordination between European and national institutions in order to identify the long-term environmental impact of genetically modified crops, crops that are neighbouring or present in nearby land, and in particular the impact on human health of direct consumption and on animal health of the use of feed made from the products of such crops.
<P>
We therefore call for greater commitment on the part of all of the institutions, so that guaranteed and accurate assessments are carried out before any genetically modified products can be authorised.
<SPEAKER ID="459" NAME="Rolandas Paksas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) It is very important for us to combine efforts to persistently oppose the release of GMOs and their use in agriculture. We must give Member States the right to decide for themselves whether they should prohibit or restrict the cultivation of GMOs on their territory. Thus when laying down measures restricting or prohibiting the cultivation of all or specific GMOs, they should consider factors relating to the conservation of fauna and flora, land use or town and country planning. In each instance, all factors should be duly justified and measures must be backed up scientifically or supported by arguments relating to risk management or other legitimate factors which might arise from the release of GMOs. For the ban to function effectively, Member States must establish a general mandatory system of financial liability and financial guarantees. I believe that research urgently needs to be carried out to determine the long-term impact of GM crops on the environment, as well as their potential effects on non-target organisms. Furthermore, the Commission should make every effort to ensure that the new guidelines on GMO risk assessment are adopted in the near future, which should make it possible to clearly identify direct and indirect long-term effects, as well as scientific uncertainties.
<SPEAKER ID="459" NAME="Alfredo Pallone" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of Mrs Lepage's report on the possibility for the Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory because I believe that every country, in line with European principles, should have the option of self-regulation in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. Many believe that GMOs are dangerous, and public opinion in general does not favour genetically modified products, but the report under discussion does not create any problems with regard to citizens as it safeguards and protects their health. Consumers do not risk anything with regard to the product, nor do retailers with regard to the market. On the contrary, in this way the Member States are free to adopt specific prohibitions on a case-by-case basis.
<SPEAKER ID="459" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I voted for the Lepage report, although I have some reservations about the possibility that Member States could limit or ban the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory. The right to decide about cultivation now being given to the Member States, to be used in a rational and balanced way, could be beneficial for some regions with unquestionably specific characteristics, such as the Azores and their wealth of biodiversity. However, political leaders need to be sensitive enough to be able to marry the various interests at stake, which are those of producers struggling to achieve lower factors of production, particularly foodstuffs for animals, given that feed and the soya produced in the EU are imported from GMO-producing countries, and those of some citizens who have the right to reject consumption of GMOs. I advocate carrying out impact assessments and, above all, evaluating the objective and unquestionable scientific reasons. This is a subject in which knowledge and responsibility should take centre stage in any decision making, which should also take into account a wide-ranging debate on the issue that involves public participation, and is always informed and enlightened.
<SPEAKER ID="460" NAME="Rovana Plumb" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (RO) This proposal is made against the backdrop of persistent opposition from European public opinion to the release of GMOs and their use in agriculture, related primarily to the fact that Directive 2001/18/EC has not been seriously enforced. The studies envisaged are not conducted by the parties requesting authorisation, whether they are studies on long-term effects, preliminary studies on receiving environments or the analysis of socio-economic impacts. According to the Eurobarometer survey on GMOs, 61% of Europeans consider that 'GM food makes them feel uneasy' and are against the idea of encouraging its promotion. In no country was there a majority of respondents who agreed with the statement that GM food is good for the national economy. The current strict authorisation system based on science, safety and the consumer's opportunity to choose will remain the same. The high level of health and environmental protection targeted by the EU legislative framework can only be achieved if all the necessary studies on the receiving environment and the conditions in the monitoring plans are available to Member States, and take account of their agricultural methods, the specific characteristics of their territory and spatial planning method. The measures adopted by Member States to cultivate GM crops must be justified and must not incur additional costs for organic or conventional farmers.

I share the approach of the rapporteur Mrs Lepage, which intends to give Member States the right to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) on grounds other than those related to health and the environment, which are assessed by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).

The decision to introduce certain foods or crops cannot be left exclusively to the EFSA, because only national authorities can accurately assess the environmental and socio-economic impacts of such crops.
<SPEAKER ID="461" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
European public opinion has, to date, been extremely obstinate as regards the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This is not just because they do not seem safe to more than half of Europeans and to public health, but also because they are considered harmful to the environment. This position is partly a result of the lack of information available about the issue. That is the background to the proposal for a regulation of Parliament and of the Council on the cultivation of GMOs in the territory of the Member States. This is an area that should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity, as a means of delimiting the competences of the Member States and the Union, as well as of scientific monitoring and dissemination of any results attained. Only through research and enlightenment will the people of Europe be able to consciously choose to accept or reject GMOs.

In my opinion, it exacerbates the problem of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), rather than resolving it. We need a standard, EU-wide solution. We do not need renationalisation, which will prevent us from achieving our internal market objectives. In addition, it will weaken the position of the EU in future World Trade Organisation negotiations. We need an overall solution which gives consumers and farmers freedom of choice, supports the principle of proportionality and, at long last, also provides a practical solution to the question of coexistence.
<SPEAKER ID="463" NAME="Frédérique Ries" LANGUAGE="FR">
By adopting the report by Mrs Lepage on measures to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a Member State's territory, Parliament has today rectified a mistake made by the European Commission. The initial proposal, which was presented in July 2010, did not allow Member States to cite environmental reasons or socio-economic considerations to justify national measures. However, Members of the European Parliament have given the 27 national governments greater flexibility to decide whether they wish to allow GMOs to be grown in their territory.
<P>
The fact is that GMOs remain a divisive issue within the European Union. The consequences are clear: the number of genetically modified crops in Europe continues to decline, falling 23% between 2008 and 2010. This is yet another reason why we need to extend the EU system for authorising GMO crops. Let us not forget that if citizens are to regain confidence, we need to impose effective criteria that reflect their environmental concerns. We need to address the concerns of those farmers who have opted for conventional or organic farming and are worried about the risk of their fields being contaminated by genetically modified plant varieties.
<SPEAKER ID="464" NAME="Crescenzio Rivellini" LANGUAGE="IT">
I should like to offer my congratulations on the excellent work carried out by Mrs Lepage.
<P>
Today the European Parliament voted with an overwhelming majority in favour of the right of Member States (and their regions) to prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory, even if authorised at Community level. This is a clear sign from the European Parliament to the Council and the Commission. The EU authorisation procedure must remain in place, but it is important to recognise that the agricultural and environmental impacts, as well as the socio-economic impacts, could justify prohibitions or restrictions by the individual Member States.
<P>
In fact, if this regulation were to become law, it would mean the possibility for European Union Member States to prohibit or restrict genetically modified crops in their territory on agricultural and environmental grounds, such as resistance to pesticides, the invasiveness of certain crops, and the threat to biodiversity.
<P>
I believe that all the Member States must introduce measures to prevent conventional or organic agriculture being contaminated by GMOs, and must make sure that those responsible for each individual accident are fined. Now it is the turn of the European Union governments to have their say.
<SPEAKER ID="465" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - This vote would clearly strengthen the hand of Member States that want to prohibit GMO cultivation under the proposed new rules, ensuring they have a stronger legal basis for banning cultivation. Clearly an EU-wide moratorium would give the greatest certainty to the Member States and the clear majority of citizens that are opposed to GMO cultivation. However, this vote would give greater legal certainty to countries or regions wishing to introduce bans and, as such, is a step forward. Importantly, GMO cultivation could be banned on environmental grounds - such as to protect biodiversity - or if there is a lack of adequate data on the impact of cultivating a GM crop. In favour. Given the very real concerns of cross-contamination of conventional crops by GM crops, including cross-border contamination, we welcome the broad consensus to make anti-contamination measures mandatory. Member States that still do not have such measures in place have to adopt them. MEPs also supported a Green proposal calling on Member States to establish a strict liability system to ensure the polluter pays for damages that might occur due to the cultivation or placing on the market of GMOs.

The final text gives Member States greater discretionary power as regards the possibility to introduce specific bans, whilst nevertheless continuing to ensure a high level of protection of human health, animal health and of the environment, and ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market. The guarantee of full protection for European consumers, who are often against GMOs and their use in agriculture for reasons other than those of food safety, is in any case assured. The text does not change the situation for Member States which, like Italy, already prohibit the cultivation of GMOs.

I also considered that it was right that the authorisation procedure at European level should not be changed, but rather should complete the decisions taken by the individual Member States, with authorisation remaining the prerogative of the European Commission, based on the opinion of the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA).
<SPEAKER ID="466" NAME="Vilja Savisaar-Toomast" LANGUAGE="ET">
I welcome the fact that today's report gives the Member States the competence to use their own territory for the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) or to restrict or prohibit them. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey on this issue, published in October 2010, 61% of Europeans say that GM food makes them feel uneasy, and the same proportion (61%) disagree with the idea that the development of GM food should be encouraged. Less than a quarter (23%) agree with the idea that 'GM food does no harm to the environment', whilst over 53% disagree with this statement. Overall, there is not a single country in which the majority of respondents agree that the cultivation of GMOs is good for the country's economy. On the issue of the contamination of conventional or organic farming by GMOs, the Commission has always justified its refusal to legislate at Community level by the diversity of agricultural practices, climates and geography among and even within Member States. This same diversity exists for ecosystems and receiving environments, and justifies the application of subsidiarity to the cultivation of GMOs, following the same logic. At the same time, the possible cultivation of a GMO should also not result in additional costs for farmers working in conventional or organic farming. It should thus be compulsory for Member States to take measures to avoid the presence of GMOs in other products, and particular attention should be paid to any possible cross-border contamination. In addition to the above, it is certainly also worth noting the question of what need there is in Europe to encourage the cultivation of GMOs when at the same time we have restrictions on several other forms of agricultural production. I supported the adoption of this report.
<SPEAKER ID="466" NAME="Catherine Stihler" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">

I voted against Mrs Lepage's report on allowing Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory. The question of authorising or prohibiting GMO crops on national territory is extremely important for both French and European agriculture. It requires in-depth scientific and environmental discussion rather than inflammatory and unworkable rhetoric.
<P>
In my view, the decision to authorise or prohibit GMO crops should only be taken once an independent expert assessment has been completed, based solely on objective health and environmental criteria and in accordance with the precautionary principle. What is more, the decision should be taken at Community level, under the auspices of the European Food Safety Agency. The same criteria must be applied to all Member States so as to guarantee fair and healthy competition.
<SPEAKER ID="466" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
The use and spread of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has sparked enormous opposition from the European public. Nevertheless, I should like to mention that this lack of confidence is due, in particular, to the improper application of Directive 2001/18/EC by the Member States. The aforementioned directive and Regulation 1829/2003 have already set out a fairly rigorous European framework which, when correctly applied, provides a high level of protection of human life and health, of animals, of the environment, and, finally, of consumer interests, so ensuring that the Internal Market will operate properly. This amendment, which respects the principle of subsidiarity, gives the Member States the final say as regards the limitation or prohibition of GMOs, and is not applicable to their freedom of circulation and importation. Once they have informed the Commission and the Member States, EU countries can now apply these measures on a case-by-case basis, in line with environmental, socio-economic and scientific criteria. These reasons must be backed up, thus preventing market distortions and legal uncertainty. In order for this directive to be properly applied, there is a need to strengthen environmental assessment and arrangements for monitoring by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), so that there can be a systematic study, in line with advances in research into the area of biotechnology.

The debate that we are holding today will have to be a debate not for or against GMOs but concerning the issue of whether we want to grant the Member States greater flexibility where they wish to restrict or prohibit the use of GMOs.
<P>
The package that was approved today is a step backwards, as it splinters the internal market. The environment and health are, by definition, problems that we can best tackle together. The environment and health do not stop at the border of a Member State. I am therefore arguing for a bolstered European approach with a more involved role for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). We need to be careful that we do not introduce a de facto ban on GMOs by unnecessarily firming up the criteria under which GMOs can be prohibited or restricted.
<P>
I argue for a case-by-case approach, in other words for GMOs to be approved where it is scientifically proven that the genetically modified organism is just as safe as the non-genetically modified organism. The study of GMOs, too, must be continued, but it must take place in a scientifically responsible manner, rather than on the basis of political dogma.

This is an issue that most directly affects the health of every individual, while research on the effects of GMOs on human health is incomplete. Therefore, in my view their use should be restricted to the maximum extent, because if the use of GMOs is to be allowed, say, as seed material, there will be no turning back - the soil will be contaminated.
<P>
Precisely for this reason, I have today supported Mrs Lepage's report, which enables European Union Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms on their territory, and I voted for the amendments that support the interests of European and Latvian residents and the position adopted by Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth in Latvia.

(FR) I voted in favour of Mrs Lepage's report and therefore in favour of allowing Member States to ban the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in their territory through new legal provisions. The report is a response to demand from most European citizens, who are very distrustful of, if not opposed to, GMOs and their use in food. Given the risks to biodiversity, different cultivation methods, the economic impact on conventional and organic farming, and the limited number of studies on the environmental and health impact of GMOs, Member States need to have a legal framework for banning these crops.
<P>
This vote sends a clear signal to the Council and Commission: that ultimately they need to improve the guidelines on assessing GMOs in accordance with the Council Conclusions produced under the French Presidency in December 2008. The Commission and Council now need to take up their responsibilities with regard to GMOs and to ensure that the Member States, such as France, will actually back this much-needed change to Community legislation. That will then leave the problem of the World Trade Organisation and the need to take the environmental and social issues into account at a global level.

The unacceptable resolution condemning the reactionary revisions to the Hungarian Constitution is blatant and insulting interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. The Greek Communist Party condemns the reactionary revisions to the Hungarian Constitution adopted by the country's anti-grassroots, bourgeois government which drastically restrict democratic rights and grassroots freedoms and further reinforce the reactionary characteristics of the bourgeois political system. However, we do not recognise any right of the European Parliament or the European Commission to interfere and determine the internal developments and political choices of sovereign states, regardless of whether or not they are members of this imperialist union. The prattling of the political spokesmen of capital about human rights and freedoms are immeasurable hypocrisy at a time when the lives and rights of the working classes in all the Member States of the EU are being crushed from one end to the other. The changes to the Hungarian Constitution are a move in precisely that direction, in order to consolidate the power of the local bourgeoisie. What the EU is seeking is an even more decisive role in political developments, including in the internal affairs of its Member States, so that it and the local bourgeoisie can join forces in imposing the iron will of the monopolies, profit for capital and a reduction in the cost of labour and crush the grassroots movement.

With this resolution we recommend the Hungarian authorities to explicitly include all fundamental civic and social rights and to ban the death penalty. The primary source of law must provide sufficient guarantees concerning the protection of fundamental rights and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. The Hungarian authorities should also ensure the existing guarantees on protection of national minorities, personal data and the transparency of publicly relevant information.

The debate preceding this vote has demonstrated the division in the European Parliament over whether the revised Hungarian Constitution, which was adopted on 18 April 2011 by the National Assembly of the Republic of Hungary and is due to enter into force on 1 January 2012, complies with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Venice Commission, the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters, has produced a number of recommendations intended to ensure that common European fundamental principles are adhered to. For my part, I was saddened by the wording chosen in various sections of the extremely conservative Constitution, particularly the ban on the right to abortion. However, as the European Parliament does not have a specific mandate to monitor national constitutions, I have abstained from the vote on the resolution.

Hungary's history and the key role that it played in the difficult years after the Second World War have made the country one of Europe's great nations. Indeed, it has made valuable contributions to the European project which build on that long history. Consequently, we were flabbergasted when we heard about the changes to the Hungarian Constitution. The changes invalidate the fundamental body of law that is essential to the institutional balance in the country. Freedom of the press, good understanding between different population groups, minority rights - these are the cornerstones of European unity. Political decision makers in Budapest need to understand how important it is for us all to converge towards these acquis, which allow open democratic expression and guarantee liberty. We need to look to the future. We need to move forwards.

The new Constitution was drafted and adopted in a very tight timeframe, and consequently did not leave enough time for a comprehensive and fundamental debate on the draft Constitution. Furthermore, the Constitution has been widely criticised by national, European and international NGOs and organisations, the Venice Commission and representatives of Member States' governments because of the lack of any political and societal consensus on this particularly important document. There is concern that the new Constitution fails to explicitly declare a number of principles, which, due to its international obligations, Hungary is obliged to respect and promote, such as the prohibition of the death penalty and life imprisonment without parole, the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, and of the suspension or restriction of fundamental rights by decree. I therefore agree with the position of the European Parliament that there needs to be a thorough and profound examination and analysis of the new Constitution and constitutional laws, which will be adopted in future, in order to check whether they comply with the acquis communautaire, particularly the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the word and spirit of the Treaties.

We therefore equally do not want to take part in any actions aimed at damaging the image or the sovereignty of Hungary
<SPEAKER ID="469" NAME="Corina Creţu" LANGUAGE="RO">
The new Constitution fails to declare explicitly certain principles which Hungary, stemming from its international commitments, is obliged to respect and promote, such as the prohibition of the death penalty and of discrimination based on sexual orientation, as well as the principles relating to the suspension or restriction of fundamental rights under special legal regulations. At the same time, the new Constitution does not explicitly guarantee that Hungary will respect the territorial integrity of other countries. Indeed, the absence of this provision, together with the unclear wording of the preamble, particularly the parts concerning the Hungarian state's obligations towards Hungarian minorities living abroad, may create a legal basis for actions that neighbouring countries would consider as meddling in their internal affairs, which could cause tensions in the region.

I voted for the motion for a resolution on the revised Hungarian Constitution because it reiterates the recommendations of the Venice Commission for Democracy through Law of the Council of Europe, specifically as regards the protection of fundamental civil and social rights, in line with Hungary's international obligations, with the acquis communautaire, in particular the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and with the letter and spirit of the Treaties.
<SPEAKER ID="470" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
As a lawyer and an academic, I am well aware that a constitution is more than a political instrument or a compilation of the legal limits of the exercise of the state's powers. It is the law of laws and the repository of fundamental rights. That is why a constitution must be ideologically neutral, must ensure a high level of protection of the citizens' rights, freedoms and guarantees, and must not - cannot - be set up in such a way as to limit the free exercise of legislative and executive power.
<P>
However, despite the concerns raised by the international community, I also know that constitutional power resides in the people through their elected representatives and, as such, Hungary and the legitimately elected Members of the Hungarian Parliament have absolute sovereignty in drafting and adopting a new constitution. I therefore believe that I should not pronounce on the specific text adopted, beyond setting out the aforementioned general principles of law.

The aim of our comments and concerns is not to criticise Hungary and Hungarian citizens, but we firmly believe in the protection of fundamental rights, civic freedoms and our shared European values, as well as peace, security and decent coexistence. All of these values should be preserved. In contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz, and ignoring the almost monarchist ideas that pervade the spirit of the preamble, the areas we regard as being highly sensitive include, for example, the previously-mentioned principle for adopting the constitution. It is not very normal in democratic countries for a consultation process to last only five weeks. It is not normal for the opposition to take no part in it. The powers of the Constitutional Court have been restricted, and the nature of the proceedings relating to members of sexual minorities is also discriminatory, as the constitution explicitly fails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. The mission of the European Union is surely for us to live together as nations and as states of the European Union in peace, cooperation and mutual respect. It is hard to see how the countries directly affected can accept the revised Hungarian Constitution.
<SPEAKER ID="471" NAME="Sylvie Guillaume" LANGUAGE="FR">
Although the vote on this constitution has certainly been conclusive, it does seem reasonable to ask whether it is truly democratic. A constitution is supposed to be a fundamental text that defines common rules and values for a national community that go beyond party political issues. I have therefore supported the resolution, which recalls these principles. The terms of the new Constitution are very disturbing: it refers only to the Christian religion, attacks homosexuality, challenges the right to abortion and expresses unbridled nationalism.
<P>
Consequently the European Commission has a clear role to play as guardian of the Treaties, and not least the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Once the cardinal laws have been adopted, the Commission must ensure that the acquis communautaire are upheld and require amendments to be made if they are not.
<P>
Let me close by emphasising that I do not consider the Hungarian Presidency to be in any way representative of the Hungarian people. The Presidency has put in a lacklustre performance during its mandate, marred by scandals linked to the vote on the law restricting press freedom, an anti-abortion campaign funded with EU money and a new constitution that reeks of ultra-conservatism. My strong sense of solidarity with the Hungarian people remains unchanged.

The Hungarian authorities are urged to address the issues and concerns raised by the Venice Commission and to implement its recommendations either via amendments to the Constitution, or when adopting future constitutional and ordinary laws. In the meantime there are calls for the European Commission to conduct a thorough examination and analysis of the new Constitution and constitutional laws, which will be adopted in future, in order to check whether they comply with the acquis communautaire, particularly the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the word and spirit of the Treaties. While the drafting and adoption of a new constitution falls within the remit of Member States' competences, Member States, current and acceding, and the EU, have a duty to ensure that the contents and the processes are in conformity with EU values, the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), and that the word and the spirit of the adopted constitutions do not contradict these values and instruments. It should be noted that Hungary is a signatory of the ECHR, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and other international legislation, under which it must respect and apply the principles of the separation of powers, checks and balances and the promotion of democracy and human rights.

To support my political family, I did not vote in favour of the motion for a resolution tabled by the left against the Hungarian Constitution because the European Union's competences do not include monitoring the wording of national constitutions. I would, however, like to express my concerns in the light of the most recent comments published by the Venice Commission (the Council of Europe's advisory body on constitutional matters).
<P>
The panel of experts criticised many aspects of the Constitution, particularly with regard to ethical questions that are very dear to my heart. Grave concerns were expressed about protecting the right to life from the moment of conception, total abolition of the death penalty, life imprisonment without parole, press freedom and discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. I therefore call on the Hungarian Members of Parliament to remain vigilant and to shoulder their responsibilities as elected representatives.

There is little else of value. References are made to the Europe 2020 strategy, the energy market, reinforcing military capacity under NATO, combating third-country protectionism and completing the grand transatlantic market in 2015: pretty much everything is covered.

in writing. - (HU) The diversity of Europe is expressed not only in a cultural or political sense but also in the context of law. Our legal traditions are not the same, and thus several different legal systems coexist in Europe at the same time. In many cases this is one of the reasons why EU legislation proceeds at a slower pace. It is the sovereign right of Member States to draw up a constitution or to guarantee the rule of law by means of other legal instruments. Nobody expects states founded on a common law system to draft and adopt a constitution, nor is the institution of ombudsman known in every Member State. Why should the European Commission make an exception in the very case of Hungary and scrutinise - even before its entry into force - the law which is to replace the 1949 Constitution drafted and adopted in the communist era and patched up with several amendments since then? The new Hungarian Constitution is based on common European values and guarantees the principles of democracy and the rule of law. The preamble of the new constitution recalls the national anthem and pays tribute to ethnic Hungarians living abroad and other nationalities living in Hungary. In addition to the contribution to European unity, it is appropriate that an article includes a provision on responsibility for Hungarian minorities abroad. It is a precondition for a peaceful European coexistence to ensure minority rights which are essential for survival. Supporting this is a natural responsibility of the motherland. At the same time, nationalities' rights to self-government, representation in parliament and cooperation are also laid down in the new Constitution. I must express my deep regret in connection with the adoption of the resolution, which is a sad and unprecedented result of political skirmishes hiding behind the protection of European values.
<SPEAKER ID="473" NAME="Louis Michel" LANGUAGE="FR">
Liberty, democracy, equality, non-discrimination and respect for fundamental rights are core values in the European Union. Every Member State of the Union is required to respect, defend and promote these fundamental rights. If we denounce infringements of civil liberties or democratic processes and discrimination, particularly in relation to sexual orientation, when these rights are flouted outside the Union, then we should also voice our concerns when those same rights are threatened within the Union.
<P>
Although the adoption of a new constitution falls under national competences, the fact remains that any Member State, present or future, has a duty to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Union's values, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Commission must uphold these values and ensure that citizens can be confident that our values are enshrined in our legislation.

Under the terms of Article 4(1) and (2) of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU does not have the authority to intervene in the process of establishing a new constitution in Hungary. The left-wing and liberal forces in Parliament have apparently agreed on the need to defend European values. In fact, their agitating tactics are pure hypocrisy. They are clearly applying double standards, for example, if we consider the discriminatory provision in the Czech constitution (the so-called Beneš decrees), which has not been subject to any criticism. One genuine European value involves respecting the national identity and the will of the people of a country, which is in accordance with the treaties and which is what the conservative Hungarian Members of this House have complained about. We must respect Hungary's democratic will. I regard the new Hungarian Constitution as exemplary and it has my full support.

The country's Fundamental Law must properly take into account the country's public and political life and must implement the principle of the rule of law. It should be noted that tax and pension schemes, family policy, cultural, religious, social and economic issues should be clearly regulated at constitutional level. It is very important for the Constitution to ensure the protection of the political and civil rights of every citizen and to guarantee the independence of the judiciary and ban the death penalty. As a democratic country, Hungary must respect the territorial integrity of other countries while supporting Hungarians living abroad. Attention should be drawn to the fact that the new Hungarian Constitution must be consistent with the European Union's values, human rights and the principle of the rule of law.

I have many reasons, but this time I would like to highlight only two of them: (1) The resolution argues that the Hungarian Constitution 'may create a legal basis for actions that neighbouring countries would consider as meddling into their internal affairs' (Paragraph H). (2) The resolution calls on the Hungarian authorities 'to amend the Constitution, including its preamble, so that it explicitly guarantees that Hungary respects the territorial integrity of other countries..'. (Paragraph R(5)). I firmly reject this tendentious and insinuating wording that reminds us of the past political discourses of the national-communist regimes of history, namely the 'non-intervention' doctrine of the Ceauşescu dictatorship in Romania, and I find the wording derogatory for both Hungary and ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring countries. The Basic Law of Hungary is fully entitled to express the responsibility of Hungary for Hungarian communities living abroad and still suffering from severe discrimination, and does not pose any harm to the territorial integrity of the countries concerned. Furthermore, I denounce the initiative role Socialist MEPs Mrs Kinga Göncz and Mr Csaba Tabajdi played in the adoption of the resolution of the European Parliament, which is little short of betraying Hungarian national interests.

One of the key points of the text is its emphasis in calling for more investments in renewable energy and energy infrastructures. The report also stresses the need for the EU to use the appropriate diplomatic means in order to dynamise the international climate negotiations while maintaining the pressure on third countries to deliver their share of global GHG reductions in the future.

<SPEAKER ID="475" NAME="Jean-Luc Bennahmias" LANGUAGE="FR">
It was an ambitious idea: to go beyond the 20% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and to build on the European Union's manifest desire to lead the way on climate change and sustainable development. It was a laudable and necessary undertaking. Mr Eickhout's report required the Commission to make proposals on increasing the target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 30% by 2020. However, some other Members thought otherwise: they refused to agree to the 30% reduction and persuaded the majority of Members to reject the report in the final vote. I feel this was unfortunate, particularly as we have already cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17% compared with 1990, which means we are close to achieving the 20% target. We should be more ambitious. It is true that the votes showed that the majority of Members favoured a 25% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but that is not enough.
<SPEAKER ID="476" NAME="Mara Bizzotto" LANGUAGE="IT">
The report proposes the adoption of a new proposal by the Commission according to which the European Union could be able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 not by 20%, as originally proposed, but by 30%.
<P>
However, it does not seem to be advisable to force an acceleration of the current plan of action. The current plan has proved to be effective and well-judged, and the European Union is already making a substantial contribution to the reduction of gas emissions. The international players we should be calling on to show greater commitment and sincerity in the battle against emissions are others, specifically emerging countries in Asia.
<P>
Greater commitment on the part of the European Union, as called for in this report, would only effectively be useful if matched by a similar effort by the other industrial powers on the planet. The European Union and its citizens certainly cannot take on the responsibilities of the other parties involved. In the light of these considerations, I decided to vote against the report.
<SPEAKER ID="476" NAME="Vilija Blinkevičiūt" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because in the absence of a global agreement assuring a level playing field on options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, a part of European industry will still be exposed to unfair competition, unless special measures for sectors exposed to carbon leakage are maintained. Progress on a global scale is the only way to solve the problem of climate change, and the EU must therefore continue to encourage its partners to meet their commitments. In turn the European Commission should work towards a structural overhaul of EU climate diplomacy which, through the involvement of the new European External Action Service and the High Representative, should seek to present a clearer EU profile on climate policy, bringing a new dynamic to the international climate negotiations and encouraging partners throughout the world to also introduce binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. I support the European Parliament's call for the Commission to come forward with proposals to increase Europe's climate ambition to a 30% greenhouse gas reduction for 2020 as soon as possible.
<SPEAKER ID="476" NAME="Maria Da Graça Carvalho" LANGUAGE="PT">
Europe's energy and climate strategy must combine economic competitiveness with security of energy supply and environmental concerns. The purpose of going beyond the 20% target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must be to reconcile these climate-related actions with competitiveness, economic growth and employment. I agree with stepping up reduction efforts from 20% to 25%, if the extra 5% corresponds to an increase in energy efficiency. It is essential to find solutions that maintain the competitiveness of European industry. In that respect, I welcome the fact that for the first time there is a broad consensus between the political groups on the inclusion of a sectoral approach. This approach will make the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set for a particular country compatible with the holistic, comprehensive treatment of each high-energy intensity industrial sector, thus avoiding the serious risk of carbon leakage.
<SPEAKER ID="477" NAME="Anne Delvaux" LANGUAGE="FR">
I agree with the target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In my view, this is a dossier which should not be politicised, so there should not be a left-right split on the issue. We do, of course, need to prevent the global temperature from rising by two degrees Celsius. However, we also need to take the current crisis situation into account, which is effectively hampering the environmental improvements announced before the financial crisis. Although I very much hope that we will achieve this ambitious target in the interests of the planet and future generations, I do nonetheless have some doubts as to whether it is feasible. I hope that my concerns are misplaced.

I voted against the report on greenhouse gas emission reductions and assessing the risk of carbon leakage, because its recommendations do not go far enough in response to the challenges of climate change.

<SPEAKER ID="478" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
At a time when the debate on CO2 emissions has become unavoidable and in which maintaining the current energy dependency on oil and its derivatives is unsustainable, it is important to find alternative energy sources that are more environmentally friendly and equally reliable. It is also crucial that Europe find innovative ways of promoting growth that is sustainable and 'greener', in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy. However, at a time of serious economic and financial crisis, not only do the political conditions for increased public investment - necessary for the objective of cutting emissions - not exist, but it is also unreasonable to intend companies already weakened by the economic situation to deal with objectives that are too ambitious and that impose increased operational problems on them.
<P>
Green growth that does not harm competitiveness requires sustainable and consistent energy policy, an emissions licence trading market that works properly, and recognition of any national projects that contribute to EU objectives. With regard to this, the important work that the energy company Energias de Portugal, S.A. has been undertaking in the area of innovation and promotion of renewable energy sources should be remembered.
<SPEAKER ID="478" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
Every effort should be made to go as far as possible in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, in order to defend the European public's quality of life and the sustainability of the future economy. The EU should strengthen its commitment to an environmentally friendly economy, even if world powers resist getting behind this priority cause. The threat that climate change represents for humanity is not decreasing, and the impact of the 2°C temperature increase is worse than previously thought. I support the challenge to the Commission to table proposals as quickly as possible, with a view to making Europe more ambitious in climate terms and making a 30% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, provided that is achievable, and that it does not impede our companies or harm their competitiveness. I also consider it essential to commit to scientific research, to technological innovation in carbon-free energy, to energy efficiency, and to creating green jobs, so that we might make the European economy more competitive.
<SPEAKER ID="479" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report touches a nerve: whilst claiming to be a leader in the fight against climate change, the EU has set targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions that fall beneath the bottom of the range recommended by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This is a fact that the continuous passing of blame to other countries does not hide. If the EU is responsible for a little over 10% of world emissions, as the report says, the truth is that its per capita emissions are almost double those of China and five times those of India, to mention just the two most often cited examples.

However, the debate about reducing targets is useless if it is dissociated from the resources for achieving these targets. In this respect, it is important to say that essential issues have been cut out of the dominant approach to the climate change problem, and that, in particular, it has been geared towards 'market solutions' and the insistence on emissions licence trading.

I voted for Mr Eickhout's report following the votes on the amendments, because it seemed to me to be a good compromise text, in the view of the fact that we are dealing with some positions that are highly compromised by ideological environmentalism and lacking any sense of realism.

There are not adequate grounds for drastically increasing the EU objective of reducing emissions by 2020, and in any case these should be based on accurate tests and a detailed analysis of the implications in terms of costs. This is even more the case at a time of a historic crisis in which too many European enterprises are closing, and too many others are struggling due to the restrictions of the credit squeeze and competition from emerging countries. Imposing additional environmental restrictions on them would mean creating more problems for them. Rejection of the final text will inevitably lead to a new period of difficult negotiation, which we will only be able to overcome successfully if we manage to combine achievable environmental objectives with support for the productivity of enterprises.

Even though extreme weather events cannot be clearly ascribed to global warming, it is highly likely that climate change is increasing the occurrence and intensity of these events. The fact that the international community failed in Copenhagen to reach a comprehensive binding international climate agreement, however, does not mean that countries are not adopting any measures, because European countries are facing key decisions aimed at preserving their future prosperity and security. The transition to the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, which is in line with EU climate objectives, can be combined with a healthier economy, growth in green jobs and innovation. In the absence of efforts to significantly reduce maximum emission values, the stimulation of investment into environmental technologies and innovation would threaten to make the EU emissions trading scheme unnecessary. It is therefore essential to make the necessary effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This will bring great benefits for European citizens through better air quality in Europe and the stimulation of investment in the EU economy.

in writing. - (DE) I am committed to combating climate change, but in a realistic way which combines sustainability and economic growth and, therefore, I have voted against this report. Why exactly have I done this? The EU climate and energy package defines the conditions for increasing our commitment to reducing emissions. We should keep to the terms of the package, including in our efforts to guarantee the security of investments. This increase in our goals will have hardly any impact on the UN climate negotiations. No studies have been carried out into how we intend to achieve the goal of 30%, in particular following Germany's exit from nuclear power. I very much value the opportunities which energy efficiency offers and have already called for a mandatory energy efficiency target in the 2009 climate report. However, I am opposed to efforts to reopen the debate about the EU commitment to emissions reductions by the back door and by means of energy efficiency measures, and to attempts to change the key features of the emissions trading system, which have already been decided on, while failing to call for any binding energy efficiency targets. Before we take any further measures, we must achieve the goals that we have set ourselves and, in particular, demonstrate that the emissions trading system is functioning correctly. We must ensure that by making calls of this kind we do not damage our credibility with our partners and, particularly, with those partners who are hesitating about joining us. We will only be able to convince them if we can show that combating climate change is not just a competition over the figures, but also an opportunity to establish a society and an economy which are genuinely sustainable.

This report describes the advantages that exist as regards job creation. According to a study by the German Government, 6 million new jobs could be created in the European Union as a result of a 30% reduction in emissions, and the result of that would be an increase of 0.6% per annum in the growth rate of the European economy.
<SPEAKER ID="481" NAME="Elisabetta Gardini" LANGUAGE="IT">
Today Parliament voted against raising the target for emissions reduction to 30% by 2020.
<P>
At various points the report referred to the presumed benefits for health, the environment and the economy resulting from a unilateral reduction of 30%, without sufficiently assessing the consequences that such a decision would have on the development of the European Union as a whole in the absence of an international agreement.
<P>
We must bear in mind that, while the environmental impacts of a move to 30% might not be significant on a global level given that the European Union only produces 10% of the emissions resulting from human activity, the impacts of such a move on the competitiveness of the industrial system would be considerable, and have serious economic impacts and significant repercussions on employment.
<P>
I would like to recall that the Environment Council Conclusions of 21 June 2011 instead underlined the importance of meeting the 20% energy efficiency objective by 2020, blocking any change to the commitments made with regard to reducing greenhouse gases. Without comparable commitments on the part of industrialised nations such as China and the United States, it would be premature to change the objectives already set without first carrying out an in-depth analysis of the costs and benefits also with regard to the individual Member States.
<SPEAKER ID="482" NAME="Adam Gierek" LANGUAGE="PL">
I voted against this draft report, firstly because industry will undoubtedly become less competitive if the EU adopts it. It would be possible for my country to implement it, and even to exceed the target, if changes were made to the instruments for its implementation, imposed by the climate and energy package. It was the Member States which agreed on the binding targets of 3x20, and they should have the opportunity to meet these obligations in the same way that they have the opportunity to shape their own energy mix, although it is evident that this opportunity exists only in theory. Secondly, I would like to remind everyone that there is no evidence that anthropomorphic CO2 has any impact on the climate. This hypothesis, which lacks scientific credibility, was put forward by a group of individuals subject to political lobbying, or in other words the IPCC, whose mistaken conclusions and scientific misconduct, for example as regards the Himalayan glaciers and Climategate respectively, are widely known.
<P>
Furthermore, I am opposed to the environmentalist lobby which tyrannises the European Parliament and to which the European Commission listens so willingly, in particular their prominent and politically ambitious representatives. Before we take the decision to make drastic cuts to CO2 emissions, we should therefore provide credible evidence that they are harmful, on the basis of the opinions of independent specialists, for example those from the Polish Academy of Sciences. I voted against, since the report ignores the fact that we should fight the effects of climate change, which most probably have natural causes, and instead states that funding is to be earmarked for tilting at windmills, or in other words the 'fight' against causes which exist independently of us.

I did not support Mr Eickhout's report, which proposes going beyond the 20% target for reducing greenhouse gases. Instead of working to achieve the so-called Europe 2020 strategy, which will not be easy, Parliament and the Commission are adding ever-more ambitious long-term objectives. In a world where the European Union's emissions are continually falling and make up close to 10% of global emissions, Europe alone cannot keep on doing more. Instead of seeking to set an example that passes the rest of the world by, let us do what we can here and now.

In today's vote, the European Parliament decided to reject the report on increasing yet further the recently-adopted CO2 emissions reduction target of 20%. I was pleased at the outcome of this vote, which sends out a strong message that decisions to increase CO2 emissions reduction targets should not be taken by the EU Member States alone. Emissions from European countries account for around 10% of global emissions. Unless action is taken by other international partners, and in particular the largest economies in the world, there will be no question of genuinely achieving greenhouse gas emissions targets. All decisions regarding further action under the emissions reduction policy should take into account the competitiveness of European industry and the risk of production being transferred to countries outside the EU, which do not impose targets upon themselves that are as ambitious as the EU's emissions reduction targets.

I regret that the Conservative amendment removed our call for the EU to increase its CO2 reduction target to 30% by 2020, leaving me no choice but to vote against the report. Europe should be ambitious in its emissions targets, just as my own country, Scotland, is ambitious - but Parliament has chosen to back-pedal. The Fukushima disaster shows that nuclear power will always be dangerous - yet Parliament has backed nuclear power. Today's vote lacks ambition and is out of touch with the citizens of the EU.

The European Union has already agreed on a 20% greenhouse gas emission reduction by 2020. This target has been set and it is quite evident that it will be achieved. There are no grounds for changing this target half-way down the road. There is no doubt that more substantial emission reductions will be beneficial for the environment and are essential, but any steps we take in this direction must be considered and must take into account the interests of all parties involved. Moreover, those steps should not adversely affect the global competitiveness of European businesses, so as to prevent businesses from relocating their manufacturing outside Europe, with a consequent loss of jobs.

If we had now unilaterally raised our emissions cuts to 30%, it would also have reinforced the message that the EU is living in a daydream. Now, though, we have shown the people that we also care about our industry and the crucial jobs that it creates, while, at the same time, we actively search for a global solution to a global problem. I believe that only in this way can we also earn respect outside the EU, and possibly, in the future, get to sit at the same table as those who take the decisions on global action.

The EU's ambitions to reduce CO2 over the next few years are extremely significant. We must remember, however, that unless the US, China and India take a similar approach, our ambitions will not yield the anticipated result. The current objective is to reduce CO2 emissions by 20%, and even this represents a huge effort for some EU Member States, whose coal-based economies cannot be shifted to other sources of energy in a short space of time. Further moves to tighten up emissions restrictions would entail high costs for the EU as a whole, and would result in EU-based economic entities being less competitive than those in the US, China or India. For this reason, I do not believe that the Eickhout report responds to the expectations of a significant number of Europe's citizens and economic entities, and I therefore voted in favour of rejecting it. Thank you.

China is already ahead of us when it comes to manufacturing photovoltaic cells, because it has more flexible manufacturing systems and a less restrictive energy policy.

The inability of the international community to come to a comprehensive binding international climate treaty in Copenhagen does not mean countries are not taking action. Results from the Cancun meeting prove that countries are taking action and negotiations have gained new momentum.

We believe that the levels compared to the existing ceilings need to be constantly monitored. The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) may stimulate investments in green technologies and innovation.

This text acknowledges that the carbon market is inefficient, but fails to draw any conclusions. Not only that: it expresses satisfaction with the fact that new nuclear power stations are being built. It does, however, compensate for these serious failings by advocating a binding commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 30% by 2020. It also puts the emphasis on the polluter pays principle and calls for greater efforts to increase the proportion of renewable energies in the European electricity mix.

in writing. - (HU) European countries are facing critical decisions if they intend to maintain their prosperity and security in the future. There is a need for a shift towards national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets which are also in line with EU climate change objectives. A healthier economy, an increase in the number of green jobs and the development of innovation must take the lead in this respect. In 2009, the European Union already reached 17.3% of the 20% carbon-dioxide emission reduction commitment undertaken in the Europe 2020 strategy. There are many who now believe that we could modify this commitment by 2020, and could perhaps raise it to 25%. I, however, do not share this view, especially not in the light of the changes that took place in EU nuclear energy policy in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. We must consider that our original commitments were already based on an energy mix where nuclear power constituted an integral part of the programmes of several countries. Were this to change, a 25% target would be difficult to achieve, all things considered. In the light of the above I therefore consider it important that Member States do not reject entirely the possibilities offered by nuclear power and its 0% carbon emissions. Based on the above, even though I supported the report as a whole, I voted against the amendments aimed at a commitment of 25%.

Mr Eickhout's report on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has led to a lively debate in Parliament, due to the strategic importance of such a request. Increasing the percentage of greenhouse gas reduction from 20% to 30% alters the forecasts of the EU 2020 strategy. It is undoubtedly important in the fight against pollution and in the protection of citizens' health, but reducing emission levels in such a short timescale also means putting European enterprises at risk on the international market. Industries would not only have practical difficulties in complying with the new emission levels, they would also lose their competitiveness outside Europe where the parameters to be respected are far less strict.

Europe must show its commitment to combating climate change. The best way to strengthen our hand in negotiations with other countries on the importance of fighting climate change is to have strong environmental protection measures in our own territories. This report would send a clear message that Europe is serious about combating climate change. Combating climate change is not only good for the environment, but can also lead to job creation and can have a positive effect on the EU economy. Europe's environmental industry currently boasts a EUR 227 billion turnover and 3.4 million jobs. Europe can be a leading light in the fight against climate change. Adopting this report would help us on our way.

Without a legally binding global international agreement under which the other industrialised nations undertake to make equivalent commitments and emerging countries undertake to make suitable efforts, there are not sufficient grounds for a unilateral increase in the EU emissions reduction target for 2020.

It is too early to recognise the Commission's evaluation of a possible 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to 1990 levels, should the EU objective of increasing energy efficiency be met (20% increase by 2020). Before proceeding along these lines a careful examination is required, along with a thorough investigation of the implications in terms of costs.
<P>
Within the framework of international climate negotiations, recognition of this result at this stage does not seem appropriate, because in the eyes of the other parties it detracts from the unilateral commitment already made by the European Union (-20% by 2020). It is also too early to recognise the milestones identified on the roadmap, before carrying out the necessary investigations for evaluating the implications for Member States.

Unfortunately, I felt obliged to vote against the Eickhout report, as it had been considerably watered down by this afternoon's part-session and by the adoption of amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) below the '3 times 20' targets of the climate and energy package adopted in 2008. However, these targets aim not only to fight against climate change and to protect the health of future generations but also to facilitate investment in innovation and in the technologies of the future.

This vote is all the more regrettable because it flies in the face of the choice of part of European industry, which has already invested in a low carbon society. In fact, eco-industries currently employ approximately 3.4 million people, which is very encouraging. This figure would be boosted if the EU climate target were increased to 30%. The creation of an estimated 6 million additional jobs in Europe should also be mentioned.

The Greens were forced to vote against an originally strong draft, after centre-right amendments aimed at fundamentally weakening the report and previous positions adopted by Parliament were passed by a narrow majority. It is with great regret that my colleague and rapporteur Bas Eickhout was forced to recommend that MEPs reject my own report after it was hijacked by amendments from conservative and centre-right MEPs. The amendments, which passed by the tightest of majorities, would have meant the final report was a step back from previous positions adopted by Parliament and, as a result, the least-worst outcome was to prevent the report from being adopted. It is extremely frustrating that conservative and centre-right MEPs continue to keep their heads in the sand with regard to climate policy. It is clear that the EU's current 20 % emissions target for 2020 is completely obsolete and that the EU needs to deliver on its pledges and step up to a 30 % reduction target. The Commission itself made this case last year. Clearly, there are plenty of climate dinosaurs in the EP.

Furthermore, the Commission Communication points out that a significant part of the carbon emissions reduction is in fact linked to the economic crisis, which has led to the closure or transfer of plants to other countries.

Furthermore, it is not certain that a unilateral move would lead to an equivalent agreement with the other major players on the global stage.

The legislation currently in force does not provide any basis for a decision to increase the EU's reduction target. The EU's objectives only include an obligation to reduce emissions by 20%. Measures aimed at increasing reduction targets yet further will harm European industry as a whole.

The majority rejected the report on the opportunities for a greater reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and the assessment of the danger of moving carbon emissions out of the EU because my fellow Members probably regarded it as not ambitious enough. However, the same majority approved via electronic voting the paragraphs which envisaged achieving a higher reduction in emissions by increasing energy efficiency without changing the current 20-20-20% targets to be achieved by 2020. I believe that every new higher target nowadays puts Europe's industry at serious risk of becoming less competitive and leaving it open to whole sectors moving out of the EU. The reason for this is that it is not definite that other industrial and developing countries will follow Europe's example and adopt the same ambitious commitments. Another reason for this is that the new targets mean significant changes to EU legislation, although the old legislation has not even come into force yet in the EU. This has disastrous repercussions for European business's planning as a global player. The last reason is that it would entail higher prices for emission quotas, bigger green investments from business and, in the long run, dipping again into the already dwindled post-crisis financial resources of the general public who ultimately have to foot the bill. First of all, let us do everything we can to achieve a global agreement on reducing emissions after showing how ambitious Europe can be.

Abandoning even any pretence at being committed to the need for a policy to promote cohesion between the regions of the EU, the new measures will reduce EU resources and the only projects that will be eligible for any form of NSRF project will be projects that promote even more decisively the single market, the stability pact and 'symbolic initiatives' on flexible work with no rights, lifelong learning, scientific research for multinationals, broadband and technological equipment from large multinationals for energy efficiency, renewable energy sources and green growth.

The future of the European project and our competitiveness in an increasingly globalised world are closely linked to the EU's cohesion policy. Cohesion primarily means unity, a close bond between the elements in a whole. This is precisely why the focus of the cohesion policy in the European Union - which is a unique project in the world, as is clearly highlighted in the report - must be on narrowing the disparities and taking special measures in the disadvantaged regions in Member States. The reason for this is that it is only if we are united and equal that we can be strong in the same European project. The centrifugal forces of globalisation do not offer any Member State opportunities on an individual basis. This is exactly why I too believe that the expertise from the richer regions must be used to benefit more disadvantaged regions so that, ultimately, the European cohesion policy will mean primarily a Europe which is united and strong in its diversity. Indeed, Europe's diversity over decades should not derive from the economic and social aspect of a certain state or region, but only from its national identity and the cultural aspect of every state, region, location or European citizen.

Most importantly, we requested that regions that are neither rich nor poor, that is, regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average, be given greater assistance. Concretely, some 10 regions in France, such as Auvergne or Limousin, could receive millions or, indeed, tens of millions of euros in additional European funds in the coming 2014-2020 programming period. That is a major victory. Indeed, it was not easy to obtain aid for these regions, which are not in the greatest difficulty. However, this measure is vitally important in helping our regions emerge from the crisis by funding very specific projects promoting sustainable growth in these regions.

Whereas at present the EU-27 are still home to some 8% of the global population, by 2050 this figure will have fallen to 5%. Particularly because of growth in China and in important emerging countries, the EU's share in the global economy will decline from 20% to around 12%. If the European Community wishes to compete economically and politically, and if this relative decline in significance is not to be accompanied by a loss of prosperity, the Community must act in a more concerted manner with regard to vital issues about securing its future. Cohesion policy and structural policy therefore have a key role to play in ensuring future competitiveness. Future policy must be oriented towards growth and innovation, but it can only be sustained by combining regional policy objectives with pan-European objectives concerning innovation, research and environmental challenges, and by exploiting the know-how of the more affluent regions. It is also necessary to reduce regional and social disparities, which prevent the EU's potential from being fully exploited, because despite the trend towards a narrowing of interregional disparities, major imbalances still exist and are actually growing among/in some Member States. I agree that cohesion policy must continue to concentrate on reducing disparities and implementing harmonious and sustainable development for all regions of the Union, regardless of the Member State in which they are located.

In my opinion, however, drawing up the line to be followed in future could also have been the opportunity to critically examine whether the financial flows in question actually need to go via the EU.

I take the view that the cohesion policy and its funds should be restricted to the poorest regions in the least prosperous Member States and that the rich Member States should not, in principle, be considered for these funds (with the exception of projects under Objective 3, where EU activity has added value in terms of bringing about transnational territorial cooperation). Slimming down the policy in this way would mean that the contributions from the richer Member States would be reduced.

While the European Commission, the Committee on Regional Policy and the Committee on Regional Development had already declared themselves in favour of the creation of a new category of intermediate regions under the 2014-2020 cohesion policy, the vote on this report was a new, essential step in this direction. Being in favour of this new category of regions, I therefore voted for this report and now call on the Council to move this issue forward. Indeed, creating a new category for those regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of EU GDP would enable them, with the budget remaining constant, to address current challenges better, particularly in terms of employment, competitiveness and social cohesion, at a time when they are suffering the consequences of the economic crisis or facing structural difficulties hampering their development. Fifty or so regions would be affected, including 11 regions in France alone.

In addition, transparency in respect of cohesion policy and its programming cycle, allocation of expenditure and access to information for potential beneficiaries of the Structural Funds is a prerequisite for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy, and transparency should therefore be introduced as a guiding cross-sectoral principle in the cohesion programming and decision-making processes in the next funding period.

My vote in favour of this report will enable the European Parliament to reaffirm its key role in guaranteeing the future competitiveness of the EU. With this vote, we propose concentrating European effort on financing border areas. These are lagging somewhat behind, in particular with regard to the progress made in the construction of trans-European networks (transport, energy, communication), which are in fact pivot points throughout the territory of Europe.

in writing. - On the Pieper, Sanchez-Schmid, Stavrakakis, Vlasak and Mikolasik reports: The Conservative MEPs have elected to reject these reports on the future direction of ohesion policy, with the exception of the Vlasak report where we have abstained. This is due to a number of fundamental reasons: it is our contention that at a time of ongoing fiscal consolidation across Member States, it is totally unacceptable that the EU's large Cohesion budget should remain untouched by these efforts. Generally, these reports fail to meet Conservative concerns regarding the EU's management of Cohesion policy in any meaningful way. They reject any moves to allow richer Member States to fund their own regional development and prevent the emergence of a smaller, more efficient and more targeted Cohesion policy towards Europe's poorest regions. Instead, new vehicles of bureaucracy such as the macro-regional entities are proposed, and the nation-state is once again undermined by a determined shift towards regionalism. This age of austerity offers an opportunity for the EU to spend less on old and wasteful priorities. These reports go in entirely the wrong direction.

The European Cohesion Funds play a key role in the EU's balance. The projects supported by these funds at regional level contribute to pan-European objectives in areas like economic growth, research, environmental protection, renewable energy supply, social cohesion, and even overseas development. This report is therefore very important, in the light of the prospective analysis it proposes for the post-2013 period. Cohesion policy encourages the principle of good governance at micro, macro and intergovernmental levels, and I entirely agree with this. I believe these instruments are crucial for reducing interregional disparities, and that these disparities can have no place in an increasingly interlinked and interdependent Europe. With a view to this sort of post-2013 improvement, I would stress the need to rigorously identify Europe's investment priorities, as well as to thoroughly analyse the macro-regional strategies. I consider it imperative for funds to be managed following a rigorous evaluation and constant financial controls throughout the life of each project. A more balanced and developed EU requires Europe's leaders to approach investment priorities and cohesion policy itself in a dynamic way.
<SPEAKER ID="498" NAME="Luigi Ciriaco De Mita" LANGUAGE="IT">
Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is in favour of bridging gaps in the development of geographical areas and sectors of society and the economy. If correctly focused on people and bottom-up subsidiarity, it allows the promotion of integrated, systemic growth, stimulating initiative and civic sense and fostering the development of responsibility and the common good. The experience of the current 2007-2013 programming period has taught that in the next programming period we need above all to give greater responsibility to the actors, beneficiaries and targets of strategic and operational programming, as well as to its implementation, monitoring and the assessment of whether objectives have been met, through programmes providing incentives and disincentives to encourage the meeting of targets and allowing greater transparency in the processes and work involved in active participation in them. It is also important to make the entire structure of governance and management simpler and more flexible, and to foster the capacity for integration of the different territories in a cross-border, inter- and intra-regional sense. Finally, it is necessary for the resources and objectives of cohesion policy in the next programming period to be in line with the challenges the EU will be undertaking, including the EU 2020 strategy. I think that the report I helped to approve shows the right way to do this.
<SPEAKER ID="498" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
The European Union's cohesion has been increasingly under threat from a number of sides, and there are even those already suggesting it will dissolve in the face of so many centrifugal forces. I do not share this pessimism and I believe that, if it is not separated from its core values, Europe will be able to emerge from this crisis strengthened. However, this is an extremely difficult task and threatens one of the principles that contributed to its initial success: cohesion. Without promoting cohesion, each part of the Union will tend to get caught up in its own interests, and to lose the notions of solidarity and helping each other that are so necessary in a political and economic area that wants to be increasingly integrated.
<P>
Cohesion policy has reduced many of the asymmetries between Europe's various regions, but it is only fair to recognise that the disparities still remain very significant. If it abandons this dimension of solidarity and loses the idea of a unit that should guide its structural policies, Europe will lose an essential instrument for its construction and strengthening. I believe cohesion policy can contribute to promoting concrete results and to our having the necessary means to achieve them.
<SPEAKER ID="498" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
In order to consolidate Europe's integration and the realisation of its values and principles, a commitment to cohesion policy that has been properly equipped with financial, technical and legislative resources is an absolute priority in terms of setting out the strategy for the future of the European Union and for it to assert itself on the world stage. Given the challenges currently posed by the economic, financial and social crisis, cohesion policy should be reinforced in order to ensure better conditions for supporting development in disadvantaged regions. This will be crucial to guaranteeing that the Europe 2020 is actually put into practice and better ensuring that the established objectives are achieved, in particular in terms of reducing numbers of people who leave school early, of increasing higher-level qualifications, of increasing the active population and employability indices, of reducing poverty, and of increasing investment in environmental projects. It is important that cohesion policy be simple to implement and flexible enough. It is also important to increase levels of cofinancing for Member States in financial difficulties, so that they can actually use any funding they are allocated.

This report is founded on erroneous principles, which then affect its entire development and some of its central ideas. The situation currently being experienced in the EU, and particularly the difficulties being faced by countries like Greece, Ireland and Portugal, demonstrates and proves the failure of the cohesion objectives written into the Treaties over the years. Cohesion has not failed because of the crisis: instead the crisis - and the varied impact it has had on Member States - is another expression of the failure of cohesion.

Some issues tackled in the report cannot fail to arouse our concern. Firstly, there is a call for a new intermediate category for Objective 1 of cohesion - convergence - for regions whose gross domestic product (GDP) is between 75% and 90% of the EU average. Secondly, the reinforcement of Objective 2 and Objective 3 - regional competitiveness and employment, respectively - is proposed. As we have always said, the creation of new objectives or the reinforcement of existing ones absolutely must be accompanied by increasing the financial resources for achieving them.

I welcome Mr Pieper's report, as I believe that, as indicated in the Treaty of Lisbon, cohesion policy is one of the bases for Europe's future development, as it specifically targets regions where development is lagging behind. It seems to me that, as indicated in paragraph 84, it is important for there to be more controls and stricter rules in the use of the structural funds, in order to avoid irregularities and fraud. I would have been happier if the attempt to present an oral amendment to remove the reference to the three working languages (English, French and German), as well as the relevant national language in which the documentation needs to be presented, had been accepted.

This report, however, does not understand coherence, and thus cohesion, altogether correctly. The report draws attention to the threat of the EU losing its demographic and economic importance by 2050. On the basis of this 'threat' it states that 'If the European community of States wishes to compete economically and politically, and if this relative decline in significance is not to be accompanied by a loss of prosperity, the community must act in a more concerted manner with regard to vital issues on which it needs to secure its future'. In my opinion, it is not for these reasons that the community should act in a concerted manner - the purpose of cohesion policy should not be to maintain the global economic positions of the EU or to compete with the rest of the world. The purpose should be the cohesion of nations and the development of a sense of identity among EU citizens, so that Europeans have the feeling that they are in their own country and that they are equal within the EU. EU cohesion policy represents a political approach which is unique in the global context, and which, in my opinion, must be promoted.
<SPEAKER ID="500" NAME="Pat the Cope Gallagher" LANGUAGE="GA">
I voted in favour of establishing an intermediate category. The Border, Midland and Western Region (BMW in English) could benefit from a new category of that kind. Currently, this region is slightly above the 90% threshold.

The report recommends that an intermediate assistance category should be created for regions with a per-capita GDP between 75% and 95% of the EU average, in order to avoid unequal treatment for certain regions. Such transitional assistance should also extend to countries like Malta, which could utilise the assistance in order to overcome the statistical effect stemming from Union enlargement. In any event, I believe that the criteria for Objective 1 status should be properly reviewed, and that such revision must take into account size, population, density and resulting problems which could hinder acceptable development for these Member States.

I abstained during the final vote on this report. Although the report adopts the new category of intermediate regions, which constitutes a significant step towards a fairer distribution of structural and cohesion funds, I did not want to vote in favour of it. The adopted report does not contain certain key issues to which ecologists cannot close their eyes: the incorporation of environmental and social criteria, in addition to GDP, as indicators for the allocation of funds, with greater consideration to be given to climate change, upcoming energy challenges and local development.
<SPEAKER ID="500" NAME="Nathalie Griesbeck" LANGUAGE="FR">
'Intermediate' regions and the territorial cooperation objective are two key elements of this report which I fully support in the formulation of a cohesion policy for the next budget period. I therefore resolutely voted in favour of paragraph 34 on intermediate regions, that is to say, in favour of the creation of a new category of regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average, for greater justice and fairness in the distribution of European funds between the regions. Fifty or so regions would be affected, 11 of them French, including Lorraine. Another key point is strengthening the territorial cooperation objective. Areas of territorial cooperation are privileged areas of European cooperation and have a crucial role to play in the strengthening of links at local level, between partners of different Member States, or between citizens preoccupied by common problems. These projects therefore need to be encouraged more. The final element is the necessary simplification of procedures with a view to reducing the red tape preventing local stakeholders from gaining access to structural funding, which, however, offers a wealth of opportunities for our territories and their future.

This also means that the issue of the co-funding provided by the countries and the regions must be completely resolved in advance of the applications. In addition, funding for transport or the environment, for example, must be used in line with the criteria of general EU policy and not simply to fill a gap in the national finances.

I voted in favour of the Pieper report on the strategy for post-2013 cohesion policy, which, of the five reports on regional policy, is a key text underlining the importance of regional and local investment cofinanced by the Union. The most important advance made by this report is the creation of intermediate regions, or 'regions in transition', which makes it possible to balance the rate of investment between regions lacking infrastructure and those having suffered the effects of the economic crisis.
<P>
In the future, EU regional policy will be fairer, the Commission having used the term 'regions in transition' in its proposal for the multiannual financial framework for the 2014-2020 period.
<P>
I am also satisfied that this cohesion policy is in keeping with the objectives of the EU 2020 strategy, but I regret that the phrase 'often tense coexistence of majority-minority cultures at sub-regional level', which was inserted by the rapporteur, was finally adopted. The Pieper report is, ultimately, the expression of solidarity and European cooperation at a time of economic crisis, when right-wing governments have but a single word on their lips: austerity.

in writing. - (LT) I welcomed this document, because EU cohesion policy has contributed greatly to the increased productivity achieved by all regions of the European Union during the previous and current funding periods. Ex-post evaluations have shown a significant reduction in economic, social and regional disparities. These developments are having a positive impact on social security and investment in environmental protection. Cohesion policy was intended to be a counterpart to the single market and to foster the development of an innovative and protective Europe based on solidarity in the face of the challenges associated with globalisation, demographic change and resource conservation, and the intrinsic potential of all regions should be exploited to boost growth and regional and social cohesion. Cohesion policy is relevant to citizens, because it brings Europe into people's daily lives. The cohesion and structural policies have proved flexible in crisis situations and have made a crucial contribution to various national economic stimulus and training programmes. European structural policy is making a major contribution towards overcoming the economic and financial crisis, as it tends to be oriented towards innovation and removing disparities, strongly encouraging European regions to upgrade infrastructure, increase regional innovation potential and boost environmentally sustainable development. A comprehensive and well-funded EU cohesion policy in all European regions continues to be essential, given the economic and social imbalances in the regions, the geographical disadvantages of certain regions (particularly the outermost regions), as well as specific structural problems and the need to adapt to new challenges.

I would also like the European Social Fund to remain part of the cohesion policy and enable a larger number of small-scale projects to be carried out locally, but the Commission must reduce the administrative obstacles which currently hamper small enterprises from benefiting from this funding.

As a result of the vote on this report, France should be eligible to benefit from structural funds for 10 or so additional regions. These funds, constituting the second round of EU expenditure, have hitherto been intended only for the richest and poorest regions of the Union, under the cohesion objective for the latter and the competitiveness objective for the former. This injustice should be remedied through the creation of a new intermediate category enabling regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average also to benefit from these funds. It is the result of a long battle, in which the French MEPs of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) exerted leadership and which made us strongly oppose the author of the report. I voted in favour of this text, as I think that an effective EU cohesion policy cannot ignore such a large part of its territory.
<SPEAKER ID="501" NAME="Bogusław Liberadzki" LANGUAGE="PL">
I decided to support the Commission's fifth cohesion report and the strategy for the post-2013 cohesion policy in view of the very real risk that the European Union will drop in significance over the next 40 years. At present, the population of the European Union accounts for around 8% of the world's population, but by 2050 that figure will have dropped to only 5%. The EU will also become less significant in economic terms, mainly due to economic growth in China, from the current 20% to around 12%. In the face of this very real threat, the EU must turn its attention to the rapid development of renewable sources of energy and opportunities for the storage of this energy.
<P>
The EU must also take a united approach to issues such as external policy and security policy, the internal market, scientific research, energy supplies and securing raw materials. Cohesion policy must utilise the advantages arising from the functioning of an international network, and increase the number of small and medium-sized enterprises entering international growth markets.
<P>
In addition, the history of the individual European Member States means that our economic system is significantly more complex than Asian or North American structures. With a view to future challenges, we should define the concept of European added value in more detail and stress it more emphatically. When specifying this concept, we should in addition ask ourselves the following question: to what extent does cohesion policy really lend impetus to enterprises? We should link European objectives to regional development objectives. We need to continue the Europe 2020 strategy and concentrate on its outcomes.

Cohesion policy has always played a key role in terms of stimulating economic growth, compensating for imbalances in the development of individual regions, and cross-border cooperation. It is important for cohesion policy to respond not only to the EU's internal needs, but also to expectations arising from the changes taking place in the world. An appropriate level of funding for cohesion policy post-2013 is therefore crucial, and the level of funding should not be any lower than it is at present. It was for this reason that I voted in favour of the Pieper report. Thank you.

I regard as a positive aspect of this resolution the significant increase in funding for Objective 3 - Territorial cooperation, which will allow us to support in particular cross-border projects for the trans-European transport and energy networks.

Cohesion policy and structural policy must have a key role in issues relating to future competitiveness, and encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to become involved in international growth markets. However, such a policy for growth and innovation can only work in an internal market without barriers and with strong harmonisation. Moreover, such a policy can be sustained only if regional-policy objectives are combined with pan-European objectives of innovation and research. Only if European programmes are the original initiators of projects, thus contributing their added value, can a strong cohesion policy be justified. To this end there should be a clearer, more aggressive definition of European added value.

Given the importance and the positive results of the structural funds from which the regions benefit and which enable them to carry out a large number of small-scale, local projects, we want this fund to remain an integral part of cohesion policy. With regard to future modifications, I supported in particular the creation of a new category of regions to be added to the current classification. Thus, regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average will constitute a new category of beneficiaries, thus preventing a difference in treatment between regions that have a similar situation.

Against the background of changes due to the economic crisis and enlargement, cohesion policy is faced with new challenges. At the present juncture, we need an ambitious European policy which will be capable of responding to the numerous challenges presented now and in the future, such as demographic changes, adapting to a knowledge-based economy or globalisation. The success of the Europe 2020 strategy depends on the future of cohesion policy. This is why I think that it is vital to continue with the three thematic objectives. The Pieper report has managed to draw our attention to relevant aspects of the future allocation of funding. I voted for this report as I regard the tasks of improving future funding and increasing its transparency after 2013 as important. Although there were conflicting opinions dividing the options which MEPs had regarding the new category of regions, the final vote demonstrated again that the Union can identify compromise solutions when it comes to its common future. Today's vote confirms for me that the post-2013 cohesion policy depends most on the way in which we manage to find the common solution to suit the 27 national interests that are sometimes different.

At least one third of the current Objective 1 regions would be able to move into this category. In contrast with the normal transitional support, significantly more European funding would be needed for regions which are actually doing well. With the new money from Europe, the regions would have no incentive for further growth. On the contrary, all the regions in a better position would have very good reasons for ensuring that their economic performance did not rise above 90% of average per capita EU GDP. Their 'reward' would simply be less funding from Europe. Therefore, I would definitely like to put on record that for me this new category is unacceptable.

Cohesion policy should not act as a catalyst for a thorough Europeanisation of social or environmental policy here, for that would massively overburden its resources. Rather, there should be a closer focus on the regional contribution to European policies (environmental protection, climate change, energy, transport infrastructure, etc.), on stimuli to growth and innovation (SMEs joining international networks, etc.), on model social projects (integrated development planning, health, demography, etc.) and particularly, under all these headings, on compensatory measures for disadvantaged regions. I would suggest to the rapporteur that the biggest threat to the EU is posed by demography. If the EU does not stimulate demographic processes, then by 2030 its population will have declined by 50 million, and 50% of that population will consist of elderly people. I voted in favour.
<SPEAKER ID="507" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
Structural and cohesion policy plays an important role, in particular in the context of global competition, because the European economic system has become increasingly complex over recent years. Against this background, it is essential for us to encourage small and medium-sized businesses to become involved in international growth markets. This will depend in particular on these companies, which are the main employers in the EU, being given increased support. Despite many promises being made over the years, in the past EU strategies have focused far too often on large businesses and multinational organisations. In overall terms, a policy which promotes growth and innovation is extremely important. The structural and cohesion policy is based on the concept of financial balance, but it still pays too little attention to rural areas. I agree with the rapporteur, who is opposed to establishing a new funding category.
<SPEAKER ID="507" NAME="Siiri Oviir" LANGUAGE="ET">
The European cohesion and structural policy certainly has a very important role to play in issues relating to future competitiveness. There must be agreement between Europe's objectives and objectives relating to regional development if we want to achieve the European added value that we want. This added value can be created, of course, by competitive and strong regions, which is why we need to use cohesion policy to reduce the large differences in development among regions. I supported the European Commission's proposal to establish a clear-cut, transparent objective for the transitional regions - between 75% and 90% - in order that the different European regions receive equal treatment when it comes to providing them with support. I therefore did not support Amendment 5, paragraphs 33 and 99, by the rapporteur, Mr Pieper, and I supported the principles set out in paragraph 34, which state that regions should be treated equally and not through an opaque system

The European Union cohesion policy needs clearly defined strategies for the future, and projects suited to the socio-economic integration of Member States must be developed taking into account the Europe 2020 strategy. The report for which I voted underlines the importance for the EU of adopting an effective cohesion policy that will allow Europe to continue to play a leading role on the international scene in the near future. Regions and small local organisations in the Member States will play a vital role, because, despite being already well-integrated into international trade, they will have to deal with the risks of a decline in economic importance, and therefore in general well-being. The emergence of nations such as China, India, Brazil, and so on, as well as European demographic forecasts showing falling numbers and an ageing population, will take away space and influence from the old continent.

In 2050, the EU will represent 5% of the world population rather than the present 8%.

This report tables a series of measures aimed at the European Union and its Member States retaining their geopolitical importance. I voted in favour and I would emphasise the need highlighted by the rapporteur to give greater stress to the regional contribution to European-level priorities like environmental protection, climate change, energy, transport infrastructure, etc.; to stimuli to growth and innovation, like integrating small and medium-sized companies into international networks, and so on; to model social projects, like integrated development, health, demographic planning, and so on; and, under all these headings, to compensatory measures for disadvantaged regions, which include the outermost regions, for reasons we all know. The creation of intermediate regions was essential for our country and for the outermost regions, and I fervently supported it.

With the vote on the Pieper report, Parliament has once again become the voice of a new ambition for European regions, as the future of our territories is being decided today. I would particularly like to highlight the proposal to create a new intermediate category of regions, which I supported. We have demonstrated the potential of regional development as an adaptable instrument which is more attuned to the realities and socio-economic needs of our regions. Many territories should benefit from this new status from 2014, when we will definitely be able to rely on a resumption of growth. The Commission is also supporting us in this initiative. We expect to enter into a dialogue with the Council in the coming weeks.

According to current demographic and economic projections, Europe will become less significant at global level over the coming decades. It is therefore essential that it adapt its global policy to these upcoming challenges. It is well known, for example, that the area of global trade has more links with third countries, in particular because of the Member States' pasts. Its linguistic and cultural diversity is also clear. As such, one option that could be pursued, and is highlighted by the rapporteur, involves advocating European added value: that is, what Europe can best offer global society. It is, therefore, about ways of solving a problem that Europeans cannot henceforth dismiss.

I voted against the amendments which intended to introduce a limit on eligibility periods for regions which have proven unable to show any significant improvements in their economic, social and environmental situation, not because I believe that Europe should be providing aid, but because the role of cohesion policy is one of development, which aims to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants and to foster the well-balanced, sustainable growth of communities.

Cohesion policy is a vital tool in achieving the Lisbon Strategy objectives. At the same time, cohesion policy is an issue of genuine relevance to citizens, making Europe tangible and visible across the EU. The current debate on the 'contours' of post-2013 cohesion policy is therefore of special importance in the context of the economic, social and institutional crisis that we are going through. In the context of this debate, the European Commission and the Committee on Regional Development came out in favour of the creation of an intermediate category between Objective 1 and Objective 2 for regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average. Convinced that this measure would enable regions with similar levels of economic development to be treated equally and prevent injustice due to threshold effects, I supported it during the vote on this resolution in plenary. Though this measure would not entail any additional expenditure, as it simply involves the readjusted distribution of current funds, several French regions - and also Spanish, Belgian, UK, German and Italian - could benefit from it.

The adoption of the new category of intermediate regions, which our group supported from the start, to reduce more effectively the development gap between the poorest regions and the richest regions is an incontrovertible step towards a more equitable distribution of structural and cohesion funds, provided that the budget allocated to this aid is not reduced. It is an idea that we have staunchly defended since the issue of the fifth Cohesion Report and one that will benefit many European regions.
<P>
However, we think that the European Parliament should have gone further by proposing a more relevant indicator than GDP and by adding social and environmental criteria to it so as to assess the well-being of the territories when aid is distributed among European regions.

I voted in favour of this text because I believe that the European Union needs to improve its strategies for post-2013 cohesion policy, in order not to lose ground to countries which, in comparison, will perform far better in demographic and economic terms.
<P>
If the European Union wishes to compete economically and politically, and if this relative decline in significance is not to be accompanied by a loss of prosperity, the community must act in a more concerted manner with regard to vital issues on which it needs to secure its future. Cohesion policy must take advantage of the fact that European networks are very strongly rooted in global networks, and encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to become involved in international growth markets.

Following lengthy discussions, we have finally succeeded in expressing a clear position on future cohesion policy: Europe needs an integrated, ambitious, simpler and more visible cohesion policy, which strengthens territorial cooperation and applies fairly to all the regions. For many months, the French delegation of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) has been battling to obtain the creation of an intermediate category for regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average. These regions, which encounter development difficulties without actually being able to benefit from additional funding, risk falling behind if we do not pay particular attention to them. Some 10 French regions could be involved. By battling hard, today in Parliament we obtained support for this category. I regret, however, the doubts expressed by the rapporteur regarding the creation of multiregional operational programmes, which are good policy tools, for territories as well as mountains or rivers. Finally, I welcome the report's enthusiasm for territorial cooperation, which incorporates my proposals for increasing the budget.

Europe's regions and towns and their undertakings already have very strong links with the rest of the global economy, for reasons associated with the European history of the individual nation states. Thus Europe's economic system is substantially more complex than its counterparts in Asia or North America. More than half of global ties between multinational corporations and their subsidiaries originate in the EU. Cohesion policy must take greater advantage of this surviving advantage of international networking and encourage more small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to become involved in international growth markets.

The creation of this new category covering regions with per capita GDP between 75% and 90% of the EU average will ensure greater fairness in the distribution of European funds. I welcome the fact that between seven and ten French regions will therefore be able to benefit to a much greater extent from European funds for the 2014-2020 period.

Cohesion policy is a key policy area for the future of the European Union. Cohesion policy is structural and is intended to contribute to reducing disparities between development levels in the various European regions, and it should pay particular attention to disadvantaged regions and those with special status, such as the outermost regions.
<P>
The territorial dimension is one of the new features of the Treaty of Lisbon and there is a need to find a more adequate response to contributing to regional development from now on, particularly as regards cohesion policy for the period 2014-2020. It is in this context that I voted for the Commission proposal of creating an intermediate category or regions covering European regions whose gross domestic product (GDP) is between 75% and 90% of the European average, which will replace the current system of phasing in and phasing out, and which will not compromise the other categories for Objectives 1, 2 and 3.

This objective is hugely important. For example, the national distribution bodies must first of all be subjected to a European approval process. Funding will only be made available when the Member States are implementing EU law correctly. The report provides for a significant increase in the funding for European border regions, which will promote the cohesion of the EU. Unfortunately, we have not succeeded in preventing the introduction of the new intermediate category for regions with between 90% and 75% of the EU average per capita GDP, which in theory will cost an additional EUR 20 billion. This proposal by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament destroys all the incentives for using this funding for structural improvements. This is a classic case of a category where regions will sit back and do nothing.

Based on the core principle of the European Union - solidarity - both initiatives seek to eliminate the significant regional, economic, and social disparities between different Member States and their regions. However, the results to date are unfortunately still patchy, and between some Member States the disparities have actually increased.
<P>
For exactly this reason, first of all, cohesion policy funding must be maintained at least at the current level. Secondly, it is necessary to state clearly and precisely that in the future, the fundamental principles of European Union cohesion policy must be Member States' gross domestic product (GDP), and it must prioritise those Member States whose GDP is less than 75% of the EU average. Cohesion policy should not apply to the poorest regions of the wealthiest nations, because they have significantly more opportunities to support their poorer regions with their own resources.

Measures such as stronger controls, more transparency and cutting red tape should all be welcomed. MEPs supported the creation of an intermediate category for those areas that have a GDP between 75% and 90%, creating a buffer for those areas that fall out of convergence, allowing more predictable planning for spending by regions.

This report represents a major step forward in the definition of tomorrow's European cohesion policy objectives. I am pleased that the less favoured regions are given due consideration in the allocation of structural funds. By giving priority support to areas where it is most needed, Europe is sending out a clear signal that it intends to further harmonise living standards in the EU. This is crucial if we are to prevent the development of a two-speed Europe, which would be synonymous with inequality among our citizens. This policy of solidarity must also facilitate the development of projects that will strengthen cross-border exchanges and cohesion throughout the territory. I therefore welcome the adoption of this text, which draws attention to, in particular, the importance of EU funds in financing the trans-European transport network and Motorways of the Sea. As far as the implementation of this policy is concerned, I voted in favour of this report, which calls for optimal use of available regional funds, In a sensitive budgetary context, where every euro counts, it is essential to foster synergies between different sources of funding.

This stocktaking process shows that, in the past, cohesion policy has made a significant contribution to creating new jobs and building critical infrastructure and has also introduced improvements in the field of environmental protection. According to this report, Parliament's proposals for the structure of cohesion policy after 2013 relate primarily to tailor-made operational programmes which focus on results and aim to achieve the overarching goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. The projects which the policy will support must have clear conditions imposed on them in advance. In addition, funding which has been paid out illegally must be recovered.

However, on the other hand, we have not succeeded in putting in place a safety net for regions which are no longer covered by the Convergence objective. Suddenly cutting off funding when regions leave the Convergence objective will put at risk the successes that the regions have already achieved and will prevent them from further increasing their competitiveness. Despite the fact that progress has clearly been made, significant efforts are still needed to reach the goal of a self-supporting economy. Slow progress in development, including a lack of research and development capacity in the private sector, too little involvement in international business cycles, companies with an inadequate capital base and serious demographic disadvantages, cannot be overcome by 2013. Of course, it is a good thing when a region no longer belongs to the poorest group, but we do not want to be lumped together in future with regions which have not made the same level of effort as we have or have not had to cope with the same conditions. For me, the magic word is a 'fair' phasing-out system, rather than an 'equal' one.

I agree with the rapporteur that it also has positive effects on the efficiency of public expenditure and on government capacity, particularly in the field of public finance management. However, we Members of the European Parliament would like to stress that there is a need to strengthen the Commission's monitoring mechanisms, and parliamentary scrutiny in recipient countries.

Strengthening national institutions and systems, making these countries responsible in the management of funds, helping poverty reduction and the promotion of democracy and human rights and, no less important, helping in building mechanisms to fight corruption are some of the objectives that some countries have managed to achieve, but there is still much to be done.

Budget support provides a means of fostering the European Union's partner countries' ownership of development policies and lasting reform processes, of strengthening national accountability institutions and systems and facilitating economic growth and poverty reduction. This support offered by the European Union helps improve the quality and effectiveness of development aid and the application of the principles of ownership and harmonisation, given that political dialogue between donors and recipients enables contributions to be tailored to the priorities countries have set in their national poverty reduction strategies. Furthermore, budget support can enhance not only the accountability of third country governments but also donor coordination through establishing the necessary dialogue on budgetary issues.

I agree that EU aid should generate real quality change in the partner countries, and therefore policy coherence plays a crucial and compulsory role in the implementation of a high-impact development policy. The European Union has hitherto referred more frequently to violations of human rights in partnership agreements rather than violations of social, economic and cultural rights, but aid agreements must take all these dimensions into account in order to contribute to sustainable socio-economic growth in developing countries.

Budget support is currently one of the most important forms of aid to developing countries, reaching EUR 13 billion in authorisations for Commission budget support in 2003-2009. Whilst, on the one hand, this mechanism makes it possible to overcome the failings of other types of aid, such as per project/subsidies, there are also some doubts about its effectiveness, not least the existence of a direct relationship between poverty reduction objectives - and development policy in the sense of the Treaty of Lisbon - and these financial transfers to the treasuries of beneficiary countries.
<P>
In line with the requirements always expressed by Parliament, I consider it essential to immediately make this support dependent on respect - which will always be verified - for rights and minimum standards of governance, on rigorous controls by the Commission in cases of wastage and squandering of funds, on transparency in the partner country's public expenditure, on reduction of poverty in all its aspects, and on the use of these resources in progressive way and in parallel with an effective political and strategic dialogue.

Budget support is the transfer of financial resources from an external funding agency to the national treasury of a partner country, subject to the latter's compliance with agreed payment terms. The funds received by this means are part of the partner country's overall resources and are therefore used in accordance with its public finance management system. Lastly, we now see budget support becoming established as the most effective means of achieving the objectives of the Paris Declaration and Accra Agenda. This approach is based on strong government leadership, the definition of reciprocal commitments, the methods used for the partnership's operation and mutual accountability. Furthermore, donor countries have also done more to harmonise their procedures and payment arrangements.
<SPEAKER ID="517" NAME="Mário David" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report analyses the future of EU budget support in developing countries, following the Commission's publication of a Green Paper on the same subject. The practical application of these policies and previous budget support require constant monitoring, evaluation and restructuring from Europe's leaders. The report points out a few failures in these areas, and states that the mechanisms for the Commission to monitor scrutiny of the measures implemented should be reinforced, and that the national parliaments of countries receiving the aid should be supported, whilst also being involved in this scrutiny. Given the nature of these policies as a key instrument supporting poverty eradication, the large-scale involvement of civil society and national parliaments is absolutely necessary. The political dialogue obtained should be on these issues, but also on the annual budgetary review. As we can see in the report, the 2006 evaluation by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) demonstrated that the impact of these policies in countries like Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua and Uganda, inter alia, had a positive effect as regards improving governance, implementing national poverty reduction plans, and improving accountability.
<SPEAKER ID="517" NAME="Marielle De Sarnez" LANGUAGE="FR">
The policy to which the EU is committed aims to make our partner countries the agents of their own development, hence the notions of partnership, political dialogue and ownership by partner countries of their own development. Budget support is a response to the latter type of relationship. It concerns the transfer of financial resources from an external funding agency to the coffers of the partner country, provided the latter meets the agreed payment conditions. At first sight, budget support may appear to be a risky undertaking. However, that is not the case, if the necessary precautions are taken to ensure that the funds are used efficiently. The fact that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must give its consent to each and every disbursement further limits the scope for abuse. All disbursements presuppose appropriate capacity in the field of public finance management of the recipient country, which must also have a strategy in place for combating poverty. The countries concerned are called upon to promote their capacity for dialogue with civil society and parliaments. Finally, closer control over public finances on the part of recipients of budgetary support may have a beneficial impact on the capacity of their tax system to bring in additional revenue.

However, the report also stresses that there is a need to strengthen the Commission's mechanisms for monitoring recipient countries. It is therefore important to involve parliaments and civil society to a greater extent in the dialogue on anti-poverty policies and in annual reviews of budget support.

The European Union has vast experience in conducting development aid processes. Despite the added value that European support constitutes for the most deprived countries, these countries cannot simply be receivers of aid, but partners and must, as such, be accountable. However much funding or aid of other sorts is provided for them, for their part they will have to commit to transparency and good management. In order for this transparency to be in place and verifiable, it is essential to involve national parliaments and civil society in the debate on managing aid received, and to make this debate a central element of annual political life in developing countries.
<P>
The awareness that something that should be for everyone is only for the few undermines social ties and degrades the already fragile social capital of the weakest societies. The Union must not let up in its development aid efforts, but must introduce mechanisms, like budgetary support, that enable European taxpayers and potential recipients in developing countries to know how it has been used, to what end and with what result.
<SPEAKER ID="518" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
Regardless of the time in question, each and every budgetary programme for investment or financial support should prioritise rigour, transparency and a proper evaluation of its sustainability, as well as guarantees that the funds will be properly and efficiently used and spent in the interests of the beneficiaries. That is the orientation that policy regarding support for developing countries should have. Independent assessments have shown that the majority of programmes have benefitted the beneficiary countries and their populations, so their continuation would be advisable. However, concerns remain about the effect of support in reducing poverty and consolidating democracy in beneficiary countries. On the other hand, these countries have great independence regarding this support. I therefore support the clear definition of criteria, a strong commitment to regional integration and the development of beneficiary countries from within, as well as clarification of compensation for contributor countries and institutions.

The funds obtained form part of the overall resources of the partner country, and are therefore used in accordance with the system used by the partner country for managing public resources. Although budgetary assistance has been in operation for some time, it expanded in the 1980s and 1990s, when the World Bank and various bilateral cooperation groups began to provide budgetary support in the form of assistance with the balance of payments. Within the framework of the second wave of budgetary support in 2000 - 2005, a new coordinated approach to budgetary support in general was introduced. The aim of this form of budgetary support was to introduce support for the policies and strategies of partner countries, in order to develop the concepts of accountability and strong partnership, and to provide a better harmonisation of procedures, methods and payment of support between aid donors.

Budget support is currently regarded as the most effective way of achieving the objectives of the Paris Declaration and the Accra Agenda.

The positive impact of budget support on harmonisation and adaptation is also noted, as well as its positive impact in terms of increased governmental involvement. Despite the fact that it has proved difficult to evaluate the impact of budget support in respect of poverty reduction and the key MDG indicators, countries which receive aid and which are eligible for budget support should demonstrate a sufficient level of responsibility as regards the fight against poverty, macroeconomic management, public finance management and government administration.

Reduction and, in time, eradication of poverty constitute the fundamental objective of European Union development policy.

This is the only way we will manage to make the European Union's common foreign and security policy have an impact on promoting democracy, human rights, peace and security, which constitute essential preconditions for sustainable development.

I am in favour of budget support, because it increases the resources of recipient countries and therefore enables them to implement their own budgets in accordance with their own procedures and, most importantly, their own policy choices.

It increases the coherence of the national budget and, most importantly, it makes the Member States accountable for the priorities and the targets they set. It enables each country to attain full ownership of its own development.

I am not fully confident in financial support for developing countries while there is no complete stability within the EU, especially given that we are talking about an increase. First of all, we should set our own house in order, and only then can we support others. I abstained from voting.
<SPEAKER ID="522" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
There is fundamentally nothing to say against development aid. It can help to free countries from grinding poverty. Of course, we must continue to take into account the fact that almost all the Member States have a huge burden of sovereign debt, which will still be a problem for subsequent generations. In recent years, numerous experts have highlighted the fact that development aid can lead to a culture of dependency and, therefore, it has been shown to be counterproductive. However, this report attempts to take a more sensible approach by helping countries to help themselves. For this reason, I have voted in favour of it.
<SPEAKER ID="522" NAME="Rolandas Paksas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) It is very important to continue to provide proper support to developing countries' budgets, but in each individual case the Commission must conduct a thorough analysis and assess the relevant indicators, prior to granting support. Furthermore, in addition to financial support, we must also provide consultative support for technocratic management of public finances, which would help promote the development of partner countries from within. However, in order to achieve this objective we must above all specify the criteria applied to budget support, in order to avoid possible deviations or poor absorption of support. Attention should be drawn to the fact that budget support must become the Commission's principal form of aid and therefore a collective EU target for budget support must be set. In providing support we must ensure democratic accountability and stop depoliticisation, and development policy measures must comply with the principles of the rule of law and democracy. We must make every effort to ensure that oil and mineral rich countries combat poverty and finance their own development through transparent tax collection systems.

Based on a series of rigorous criteria, such as well-defined economic development policy and strategy, valid projects guaranteeing macroeconomic stability and a credible programme for improving public finance management, the European Union grants funds to developing countries. Many of these countries are Europe's tradel partners and therefore offering budget support for their development also means providing incentives for our companies to invest, boosting commerce and creating new jobs. The aim of doing this is also to give greater stability to the governments of these countries, and consequently better prospects of stability and better living conditions to the entire socio-political structure.
<SPEAKER ID="522" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
Budget support means transferring financial resources from an outside financial body directly to a country's national treasury, with that country having met the agreed conditions of payment. The financial resources received from this then become part of the partner country's general resources and are, therefore, used in line with its system of managing its public finances. This mechanism has existed since the Marshall Plan, and has been popular since the 1980s and 1990s, when the World Bank and various bilateral cooperation structures began to provide such support in the form of balance-of-payments aid. The nature of this aid mechanism obliges the involved entities to seek ways of monitoring how these funds are actually spent. As such, Parliament has made it politically imperative for this aid to only be granted to countries that meet minimum standards of governance and respect for human rights. The aid awarded has a great impact and includes three countries whose official language is Portuguese: Cape Verde, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau. I voted in favour of this report for these reasons.
<SPEAKER ID="522" NAME="Miguel Portas" LANGUAGE="PT">
The European budget is one of the most important aid instruments for developing countries. Used to reduce and eradicate poverty, and to implement the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), its use must be governed by principles of transparency. Given that financial transfers are made directly to the treasuries of developing countries, respect for human rights and compliance with minimum standards of governance should be ensured. The creation of control systems involving parliaments and civil society can guarantee greater effectiveness in the struggle for transparency and in combating corruption, without calling into question the interests of the people. I am voting in favour of the report for these reasons.
<SPEAKER ID="522" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
Budget support for developing countries is one of the frameworks characterising common foreign policy. However, simple financial aid is not enough to improve local institutions on its own. Indeed, according to the data we have seen, it is difficult to even evaluate the impact of these measures on budget support, since, for example, it creates a certain sense of third countries' dependency on the awarded aid, which suggests that there is no structural progress. For example, it is feared that the result of the cut in aid will involve a drop in provision of basic services. However, Parliament is not contesting the benefit of this type of measure: instead, whilst committing to it working properly, Parliament is demanding that the criteria laid down for making it available be followed, according to objective analyses, so as to contribute to consolidating local structures geared towards respect for the inviolability of the person. In the end, this suggests an active posture on the Union's part, acting as a political player committed to the global stage.
<SPEAKER ID="523" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - In favour. Budget support is the transfer of financial resources from an external funding agency to the national treasury of a partner country, subject to the latter's compliance with agreed conditions for payment. The funds thus received are part of the partner country's overall resources, and are consequently used in accordance with its public finance management system. Although budget support has been granted for some time (since the Marshall Plan, in fact), it became popular in the 1980s and 1990s when the World Bank and various bilateral cooperation structures began to provide such support in the form of balance-of-payments aid. A second wave of such support in the period from 2000 to 2005 introduced a new, coordinated approach based on general budget support. This form of budget support was intended to further the policies and strategies of partner countries with a view to developing the concepts of ownership and closer partnership more fully.

In this regard the Commission should show the eligibility criteria and the results achieved in the area of public finance management in a clearer, more formal and structured way. Finally, as already pointed out by the European Parliament, I emphasise the importance of setting up a system which systematically involves parliaments and civil society in political dialogue on poverty reduction and in annual reviews of budget support.

The European Union in fact grants budget support solely to countries in which the following three eligibility criteria are in place or in the process of being put in place: a) a well-defined national development policy and strategy, b) a stability-oriented macroeconomic framework and c) a credible and appropriate programme for improving public finance management, and therefore a clear interpretation is necessary.
<SPEAKER ID="524" NAME="Bart Staes" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">

Those Member States in receipt of support must thus make an adequate contribution of their own when it comes to combating poverty, macro-economic management, managing government finances and governance before they can receive budgetary support.
<P>
In reality, there are enormous differences between the recipient countries. Budget support must be inextricably bound up with a strong political dialogue. The leading role of the national parliaments of the recipient countries, civil society organisations and local authorities is crucial. They are, after all, best placed to identify priority sectors, prepare Country Strategy Papers and monitor budget allocations. In order to strengthen parliamentary supervision, national parliaments must consult with civil society. The report demands a system of information exchange between civil society and the general public with a view to following up on budget support.
<P>
Budget support, just like programmed aid, should be treated as a transitional instrument and should not hamper efforts to strengthen countries' capacities to raise own resources, such as taxes, in order to become independent from third country donation. Budget support may even be cut back in certain cases (in the case of emerging or oil and mineral-rich economies).
<SPEAKER ID="524" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
The role of the EU as the world's second-largest donor of development aid takes on numerous forms. Budget support is one method and it is carried out by transferring financial resources from an external body directly to the public accounts of a third country. Budget support reinforces concepts of ownership and partnership, as it imposes more responsibility on third countries for the commitments they have made and for increasing mutual cooperation on achieving the objectives of the policies and strategies they have set out. On the one hand, this method also enables greater coordination between donor countries and increased harmonisation of procedures. It is clear from a number of reports and Commission assessments that budget support has an effect on the development of the countries in question. However, there is a need to clarify eligibility criteria, which differ between beneficiary countries, to promote the participatory development of civil society in monitoring expenditure and the impact of this method, and to reinforce coordination between Member States' bilateral aid and between the EU and international organisations. The cross-cutting nature of the problems makes increased consistency between the various development aid policies necessary, readjusted on a case-by-case basis in line with each country's specific characteristics.
<SPEAKER ID="524" NAME="Dominique Vlasto" LANGUAGE="FR">
I supported this report on the future of EU budget support for developing countries, which reaffirms the conditions in which this policy of solidarity with the poorest people needs to be implemented so as to eradicate poverty. It is essential to strengthen the accountability of recipient countries with regard to EU budget support and the use they make of it. This is crucial, if we are to deal with our partners on an equal footing and if we are to ensure that the support provided actually meets the objectives pursued by the EU. All too often, the capacity to absorb this support is overestimated, which leads to it being wasted or spread too thinly. I do not want the financial support given by the EU to developing countries, which represents a significant proportion of its budget, to be provided without prior conditions and with no follow-up. I am therefore in favour of effective control and assessment mechanisms being established all along the funding chain. What is more, I wish to stress the need to involve the civil society of developing countries in this process, as the people themselves must be the real beneficiary of EU budget aid.

Obviously it is important to avoid the many errors and the wastage of money which have been noted in recent years - at the expense of taxpayers in Europe, I would like to emphasise - and which in most cases did not result in any penalties. If we really want to give real support for the most needy populations, the EU foreign and security policy must focus on the promotion of democracy and human rights, as well as peace, key conditions for sustainable development. All necessary measures must be taken in order to combat corruption in the recipient countries, including appropriate penalties such as, for example, a percentage deduction from future instalments.

We Members of the European Parliament reiterated that, while the responsibility for the planning and development of infrastructure projects lies mainly with the market, the EU has a role in promoting certain projects by awarding them the status of 'project of European interest' and providing public financing for some of them. However, it is of utmost importance to establish a clear and transparent methodology for selecting priority projects that meet pressing European needs. 'Projects of European interest' should not undermine the interests of one Member State in order to satisfy the interests of another Member State, as has happened in the past. I agree with the rapporteur that the selection of projects of European interest (PEIs) should be conducted on the basis of objective and transparent criteria, and with the involvement of all stakeholders. It is essential that all PEIs should contribute to achieving EU energy policy objectives - the completion of the internal market, the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy, and the enhancement of security of supply.

Mr Wagner's report clearly shows the importance of an integrated European energy network, in order to be able to guarantee security of supply and diversification of sources.

I believe that in order to achieve these objectives, enshrined also in the recent Treaty of Lisbon, it is right to give priority to energy infrastructures, which the Commission also considers to be outdated and poorly interconnected.
<P>
We must face this infrastructure deficit, and the measures contained in Mr Wagner's report do precisely this. The difficulties and crises in bilateral relations between energy consumer countries and producer countries are further proof of the fact that we have to think to the future, to an energy policy for the European Union.

TheTreaty of Lisbon provides a specific legal basis for developing an EU energy policy for the first time in the history of the EU, promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders, which is necessary to achieve the other EU energy policy and solidarity objectives (functioning of the energy market, energy efficiency and renewable energy, security of supply and diversification of energy sources and forms of supply). The EU's major energy challenges are confronting climate change, strengthening energy security and autonomy while reducing overall energy use as well as fossil fuel imports and dependency, diversifying energy suppliers and sources, promoting a competitive internal energy market and ensuring universal access to sustainable, safe and efficient energy at an affordable price. I agree that the timely, correct and full implementation of existing legislation is crucially important, including the regulatory work called for by the third internal energy market package. There is a need for new proposals in this area in order to achieve an integrated and competitive European internal energy market by 2014 at the latest.

The European Union has a crucial role to play in the field of energy, which is an area for which a European approach is fully justified. The stakes are high: security of energy supply; diversification of means of production; projects of European interest. However, all this can only be achieved at European level. This own-initiative report deserves credit for making this point and is thus a step in the right direction. What we lack above all in the field of energy and in the fight against climate change is political will. I voted in favour of this report, and I will pay close attention to the proposals to be made by the European Commission on energy infrastructure in October. We will also need to monitor closely the drafting of the next multiannual financial framework to ensure that a sufficient budget is allocated to enable the development of a true common energy policy at EU level. EU energy infrastructure projects should be funded through Eurobonds in particular, which would increase investment and ensure complementarity of public and private partners.

This objective is even more ambitious than in the past as it embraces energy as a whole. In my view, the energy and climate package effectively sums up the European energy priorities, on the basis of which the European Union can orient its strategic measures.
<P>
The Green Paper 'A European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy' has been recognised as the most ambitious document to date on European energy policy, but it was only with the Treaty of Lisbon that the primary objective of promoting interconnections between energy networks was sanctioned.

These infrastructures are vital for achieving ambitious objectives, such as guaranteed security of supply, safety in energy production, price stability for consumers and the development of a single energy market that ensures access to energy sources at affordable prices for European businesses.

I supported this report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond because it is a practical expression of the usefulness of the European Union for citizens. The report touches on aspects that are going to have a very big influence on the well-being of citizens, such as better access to various energy sources which are less costly, more environmentally-friendly and more efficient in generation, distribution and consumption. This report will help determine the infrastructure necessary to achieve these objectives; lay down the criteria for designating 'projects of European interest'; ensure the implementation of projects within a reasonable timeframe, guaranteeing debate, information and public participation; improve cost allocation; and secure funding that will attract and boost private investment.

The sudden interruptions in energy supplies that have hit Italy and many other Member States in recent years show how important it is for the EU to clarify its energy policy objectives and to develop a coherent strategy, both in the EU and in supplying and transit countries, in order to prevent the recurrence of interruptions.

For these reason, I voted in favour of this report. However, I would like to point out that the promotion of an efficient energy strategy must not turn into indiscriminate support for the authoritarian regimes of Central Asia, nor must it weaken the EU's position towards Turkey, which, thanks to its position as a transit country, is constantly increasing its bargaining power with the EU. I therefore voted in favour, but with the conditions outlined above.

I voted in favour of this report, because in order to achieve the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and integrate a still larger share of renewable energy sources into the energy mix beyond 2020, there is a need to upgrade and modernise the EU's energy infrastructure. Furthermore, we need to develop smart and super grids, build interconnections and extend gas grids, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance security of supply. An EU approach to improving Europe's energy infrastructure is necessary as individual Member States cannot achieve this on their own. It should be noted that environmental benefits do not necessarily occur in those countries that make the required investments, and therefore we need to think about long term objectives, so that energy infrastructure planned today would serve us well for several decades. I agree with the European Parliament's position that it is essential to draw all the necessary conclusions from the existing directives and the provisions of the so-called third internal energy market package and then to establish the basis for planning and investment in the European network. We also need to establish improved EU financial instruments to back regional and local authorities as they seek to invest in sustainable energy production.

As far as electrical power is concerned, the Commission should progress with the issue of definition and the implementation of its proposals regarding priority corridors that should link up European transport networks by 2020, specific proposals in the area of infrastructure and the connections essential for integrating power generation from renewable sources. It is vital to speed up the identification and construction of electricity highways. The new network infrastructure should include 'intelligent networks' based on sources provided by new information and communications technology. 'Intelligent technologies' should enable citizens to control their household consumption, thus avoiding waste and reducing both their individual and shared costs.

Natural gas presents us with specific problems. I am concerned about our dependence on a single source in Eastern Europe, as this can lead to problems over security of supply, as we have seen in the past. In my opinion, diversification of sources ought to be the touchstone of a new policy which strives for security of supply.

The 'Connecting Europe Facility' aims to speed up infrastructure investment in the areas of energy, transport, and information and communication technology (ICT) with a EUR 40 billion budget for the 2014-2020 period.

The Union plays an important role in promoting certain projects, by conferring the status of 'project of European interest'. There is therefore a need to make the way such initiatives are chosen more transparent, and this must be done on the basis of objective criteria and with the involvement of stakeholders. These projects should be geared towards achieving European energy targets, specifically: concluding the internal energy market, promoting energy efficiency, integrating markets, increasing competition and the quality of services provided, and developing cross-border links, amongst many others.

The overarching vision of this report is of developing energy infrastructure in a framework of market economy models. As such, it is part of the process of pursuing the third package on the internal energy market, and is another step in this direction. Its goal is to enable the free exchange of power on all transmission interconnectors between countries and/or different price areas: in other words, the liberalisation of the energy market.

We do not share this vision and are directly opposed to it. Although cooperative measures are needed and desirable in this area, the development of energy infrastructure should be the responsibility of each Member State, taking into account its specific characteristics and needs, and the interests of its population, productive sectors and economy. This must have a framework of public management and ownership, as a means of ensuring a genuine public service and energy supply. The report runs counter to this, mentioning that public Union funds intended for supporting projects to develop infrastructure will be channelled into projects of European interest: in other words, those that contribute to creating the internal energy market, and to increasing integration, competition and market liquidity. This path has already shown itself to be profoundly negative for a number of countries and their populations.

Progress has not been easy in the EU, and there are many sticking points between the States in the area of energy policy, with fragmented markets and many national interests standing in the way. Only through determination and by having an energy policy can all of the obstacles be overcome. Both of these elements form part of the 'Energy 2020' communication, which calls for a radical change in the current approach to highly important issues such as energy infrastructure and networks, which should be mobilised and supported under the banner of 'Europe making effective use of its resources'. In my opinion, we need to focus on energy structures that are highly important from the perspective of fulfilling objectives the EU has been pursuing for decades: in other words, reducing carbon levels, ensuring security of supply and price stability for consumers and creating a single market in energy which will ensure access to energy resources for businesses and individuals at affordable prices. Solidarity between Member States is also important from this perspective, and we cannot talk about security without also mentioning solidarity within a European framework. It is time that Europe began to act in a unified way, setting itself common objectives in the short, medium and long terms in the area of energy policy, in the interests of European citizens and businesses.
<SPEAKER ID="530" NAME="Gaston Franco" LANGUAGE="FR">
I welcome the adoption of this report, which is undoubtedly a step towards an EU energy policy promoting the successful interconnection of energy networks between Member States across national and regional borders. In order to address major challenges in the development and security of energy infrastructure in Europe, the European Parliament wished to adopt an own-initiative report in anticipation of the legislative proposal concerning a new European instrument in this field. Interconnection capacity or its availability between Member States still remains insufficient in one-third of the Union. Modernisation, cross-border interconnection and timely adaptation of energy infrastructure are essential to achieving the energy objectives for 2020, especially those concerning the share of renewable energy sources in the energy mix of Member States.
<P>
Market-based tools and the user-pay principle should remain the basis for financing energy infrastructure. However, the rapporteur realistically identified criteria defining projects 'of European interest' likely to obtain public finance, which has to result in an innovative mix of financial instruments that levers private investment.

The European Union currently imports over 50% of its energy from non-EU countries, which increased their prices by an average of 15% last year. This situation highlights the importance of diversifying energy supply routes and of building an interconnected, flexible grid, which will overcome national bottlenecks and allow efficient energy supplies in the various areas of Europe.
<P>
In this regard I agree with the rapporteur on the importance of selecting projects according to the clear priorities of European interest and balanced development in the various regions. Finally, financing procedures need to be simplified in order to attract more private investments, which have been slightly down in recent years but are crucial for open and transparent energy development.

It makes no sense to assume that the optimal infrastructure will come into being spontaneously, and that we need only establish the legal rules of play, and market forces will do the rest by themselves.

Only then can this project be the subject of further legal and procedural negotiations. I am voting in favour of this much-needed project, but I have not lost hope that the multi-stage procedure for the design of European energy infrastructure, as described above, will be implemented at both EU and international level, and will result in the desired solutions.

Although this does not specifically apply to Malta, and is a statement made in reference to other Member States, any distortion of this term can potentially lead to the isolation of Malta in these matters. Due to its geographical positioning and a general lack of resources, the country has no gas connections to the continent and is, therefore, completely dependant on foreign fossil fuel imports. In light of this fact, it is extremely important that Malta remains properly linked in to European energy networks, and it would therefore be impossible for me to vote in favour of a report that could jeopardise the country's energy security

I welcomed this document, because our objective focuses on energy infrastructures which, in the Commission's opinion, are outdated and poorly interconnected. They are essential in order to reduce carbon levels, guarantee security of supply and price stability for consumers, and also develop a single energy market that ensures access to energy sources at affordable prices for all businesses and citizens. On top of that there is solidarity between Member States, as it is not possible to talk about security without also mentioning solidarity within Europe. We are facing a whole range of urgent issues, including the spectacular increase in wind electricity generation in the regions around the North Sea and the Baltic, the huge renewable energy potential in southern Europe and North Africa, problems with large-scale electricity storage, the need to charge electric vehicles, and CO2 and hydrogen transport and storage. It is impossible to tackle all of these unless we envisage new networks and new interconnections both within the EU and with third countries. I believe that we need to: determine the necessary infrastructure; lay down the criteria for deciding which projects should be classed as being of European interest, taking account of balanced development in the various regions; ensure that these projects are implemented within a reasonable timeframe, working out formulae with which to resolve the controversial matter of authorisation procedures and the awarding of licences in the Member States, guaranteeing debate, information and public participation; improve cost allocation; secure financing that will attract and boost private investment.

We also need new infrastructure to complete the single energy market - especially as we start the move towards green energy. This means the greater decentralisation of energy sources and thus better networks. The Commission is planning major renewable-energy projects in the North Sea and North Africa. However, it would be futile to build energy projects if the networks that they will connect to are too old to cope with the new energy. Europe needs more internal and international interconnectors. We must ensure that supply routes serve the general European interest and not that of individual Member States. At the same time as it builds new routes, the Union must also focus on the modernisation of national grids, and support the Member States in this task. This is especially true in Central and Eastern Europe, where the grids are the weakest. Member States need to rebuild their networks. In order to do so, they need clear EU rules on what state aid they can provide and where they can build. Thank you.

That is why it is good that Parliament should clearly express its view today, giving its support and making proposals for improvements both to the Commission and for the Member States' information.
<P>
Key factors in the EU's future energy strategies will be: responding to climate change, strengthening the security of supply of energy and energy independence, and cutting overall consumption of energy, and all this calls for effective preparations right now. That is why it was an easy decision to vote in favour of the report, even if there is still some way to go from all the fine words to getting things done.
<P>
Unfortunately, at present the situation is not actually very good: the EU is paying a high price for an antiquated, poorly interconnected energy infrastructure - in many different ways. The recent disruptions to the gas supply reminded us of this, being an example of how there is no option for reverse flows. In the longer term too, the target for cutting the EU's carbon dioxide emissions will create a need for development, because there will be a dramatic increase in the use of electricity and growing pressures on large-scale energy storage and transmission. In the same way, the development of renewable energy sources will require heavy investment in smart, efficient and competitive energy networks, so that we may avoid interruptions in supply and unnecessary losses.

I decided to vote in favour of the report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond, which represents progress towards the drafting of an agreement on the creation of an integrated European energy network. It is important for the Heads of State or Government to ratify a common energy policy (the 'one voice' strategy), which should become part of the common foreign policy.
<P>
On the other hand, this report sets out very interesting and promising objectives, such as the sustainability and the promotion of renewable energy sources, competitiveness and the opening up of markets, security of supply and the diversification of energy sources, as well as the famous 'three twenties': reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, increasing energy efficiency by 20% and increasing the use of renewable energies by 20%. These are sensible proposals, and consequently deserve our support.
<P>
Something else we cannot forget is infrastructure, which in the Commission's opinion is 'outdated' and needs to be reformed. These reforms are of vital importance for achieving one of the EU's most important goals in this regard, namely the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Increasing the generation of electricity from wind turbines will create favourable conditions for continuing reforms of energy infrastructure.

It is vital to take action on demand and the new objectives of the European energy policy, in other words sustainability and the promotion of renewable energies, competitiveness and the opening up of markets, and the security of supply and diversification of sources. The latter should be a key feature of a new policy geared to safeguarding supply. The famous 'three 20s' is the shorthand way of expressing European priorities, and could even be described as the compass for European policy measures which has also been adopted by the European Council.
<P>
We believe that we need to identify the necessary infrastructure, lay down the criteria for deciding which projects should be classed as being of interest, and secure financing that will attract and boost private investment. The fact is that very strong political commitment and substantial investment are required for any solid progress to be made.
<P>
Finally, we believe that where a project has been designated as being 'of European interest', a single contact authority should be nominated in the Member State (one-stop shop). This authority should act as an interface, ensuring understanding and communication between developers, authorities and affected residents, and should ensure coordination between one-stop shops and the Commissions Directorate General for Energy.

We are all aware that the main challenges we face regarding energy policy consist of facing up to climate change, and increasing energy security and independence, whilst simultaneously scaling back global energy consumption, as well as fossil fuel imports and dependency. We also need to diversify supplier countries and energy sources, whilst creating a competitive internal energy market and ensuring universal access to an energy supply that is sustainable, affordable, safe and effective. In order to achieve this, we need to prioritise investment in energy infrastructure, to make it more efficient and less obsolete in the medium and long term.

The clear goals presented in the report are to: 1. increase market integration, competition and market liquidity and reduce market concentration; 2. put an end to energy islands; 3. reduce network losses, preventing transmission bottlenecks - including internal projects as long as they contribute to the development of cross-border interconnections - and relieve cross-border transmission; 4. resolve single-supplier dependency; 5. diversify transit routes and the origin of resources; and 6. integrate renewable energy to the grid and increase the use of renewable energy sources by reducing renewable-energy curtailment.

All the previous energy policy strategies at an EU level have failed to achieve the desired success. Deregulation in particular has not brought the promised financial improvements for customers. In addition, the bills are still in some cases difficult to understand. Of course, it is important for us to guarantee Europe's security of supply. However, the EU continues to focus too heavily on nuclear power in this respect and not enough of its funding programmes are targeted at developing alternative forms of energy. Many concepts are also still incomplete. For example, the problem with wind energy has so far been storage. It is currently only possible to store electricity on a large scale without drastic reductions in efficiency by using pumped storage plants. In order to accommodate the predicted doubling in the amount of electricity generated, this means that a corresponding increase in the number of storage plants is needed. In addition, the effective integration of renewable energy sources will only be possible when the energy transport networks have been extended and reinforced. Against this background, the concept in this report seems to me not to have been fully thought through and I have voted against it.

in writing. - (LT) The EU's current energy infrastructures are technologically outdated, poorly interconnected and are unable to ensure an adequate or secure supply of energy. End consumers suffer greatly as a result, because prices are constantly fluctuating. Consequently, there needs to be constant cooperation at national and European levels, in order to successfully complete the internal energy market, implementing infrastructure projects and eliminating energy islands. Only through joint efforts can we implement cross-border projects and achieve efficient and intelligent interconnections between local and regional energy sources and large energy grids. When implementing priority energy infrastructure projects we must maximise the efficiency of the EU funds. Furthermore, subsidies for energy infrastructure, research and development must be allocated on a geographical basis. In order to achieve EU energy and climate goals, we must set the priorities for the selection of projects of European interest. We must involve as broad a section of society as possible in the implementation of an energy infrastructure project from the first stage of its development, in order to spread information as widely as possible and exchange best practice. All levels of civil society must be involved in the consultation process. Oil will continue to be important for many years to come and European oil transport and refining infrastructure must remain competitive in order to ensure a secure and affordable supply to EU consumers.

I voted in favour of the report by Mr Wagner because within the Europe 2020 strategy it is important that the European institutions, and specifically the European Parliament, should define the objectives to be achieved in greater depth. Specifically, as highlighted in the main objectives of the Treaty of Lisbon, energy is the priority. In the field of energy Europe is attempting to take an important step forwards by reducing greenhouse gases, achieving total energy efficiency, and changing over to renewables. As a result investments in energy policy have increased dramatically, and energy has become a crucial issue for the future of everyone, which needs to be managed at EU level.

I voted in favour of the own initiative report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond. The way in which we plan, develop, fund and operate our energy infrastructures and systems in Europe will determine our ability to reduce our energy dependency and thus to improve our energy security. The energy resources that the EU has at its disposal can be used as a driving force for growth in the European economy as a whole. The funding and implementation of energy infrastructures is of particular interest to the countries in Southern Europe, such as Greece, which have renewable energy sources, such as the sun, wind and sea. These sources can be used for the benefit of national growth. Furthermore, these countries can help to reduce Europe's energy dependency.

On the 60th anniversary of the foundation of the European Coal and Steel Community, this report on energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond approves a series of measures aimed at creating an integrated European energy network. Europe is far from having reached the goal of a genuine internal energy market, but it is time for it to speak with one voice in setting joint short-, medium- and long-term energy policy objectives. This voice should be clearly audible and should make itself heard throughout the structure of the Union, for the benefit of the European public and EU businesses. I voted in favour of this report, which introduces very ambitious projects. However, I would warn that these projects are inconceivable without the determination and diligence of energy sector businesses, which must make every effort to implement them. Nothing can be achieved without the resolute involvement of the European institutions. Up to now, despite its laudable initiatives and sustained efforts, the EU's common energy policy has lacked a resolutely 'European' impulse.

Substantial investments need to be made in the energy infrastructure for us to achieve our goal: a low carbon economy by 2050, risk management (operational, environmental, political, man-made, terrorist attacks) and socio-economic impact.
<P>
I endorse the recommendation to Member States to provide adequate information to citizens, civil society, economic operators and social partners about integrated energy grids, supply security and the integration of renewable energy sources to enable consumers to benefit from new technologies and intelligent energy use with a view to increasing energy efficiency. Furthermore, I should emphasise the need to increase public participation in the decision-making process for implementing this new methodology in order to prioritise projects according to citizens' needs.

Since its inception, European energy policy has been a bulwark of the European project. Then as now, the Member States' sustainability and energy interdependence make an essential contribution to the success of the Union. The intention is currently to find a guiding policy, which should involve strengthening, in general terms, the connections between the energy networks of the various Member States. It is important, for example, not just to support energy production, but also to encourage energy being shared and full use being made of it. In organisational terms, it is important to move towards the harmonisation of permits and authorisations for production, transportation and sale, which are different in each Member State. Finally, it is important to find substantial sources of funding that will enable the success of the project. That is the purpose of this report.

However, a third of Member States have still not reached the 10% interconnection capacity objective we set in 1992. For that reason, we wish to reiterate the European Union's commitment in regard to this objective and, more importantly, to insist that it be monitored in the same way as the 20-20-20 targets: a reduction in greenhouse gases, increasing the use of renewables and improving energy efficiency. Also, therefore, the development of infrastructure considered to be of European interest cannot be solely dependent on the will of Member States nor must it solely be based on commercial criteria. The ten-year network development plan (TYNDP) is a small advance but after the first financial year last June we have observed that, in general, the European vision is missing. We ask that this bottom-up approach be complemented by a structured top-down approach that incorporates a European perspective.

I voted in favour of the report, which, among other things, emphasises the view that a European approach, developed in cooperation with all stakeholders, is needed in order to fully exploit the benefits of new infrastructure, and stresses the need to develop a complementary, harmonised method, in line with the rules of the internal market, for the selection of infrastructure projects. It also emphasises that this method should take into consideration the European regional perspectives in order to remove disparities, and to optimise the socio-economic and environmental effects.

I voted for the report because it reiterates that, while responsibility for the planning and development of infrastructure projects lies mainly within the market, the EU has a role in promoting certain projects by awarding them the status of 'project of European interest' and in providing public financing to some of them, but it calls for a clear and transparent methodology leading to the selection of priority projects that meet pressing European needs. The report shows that, to justify projects being accorded priority, the following criteria should be taken into account: the project must have a European dimension, in other words clear EU public interest; its necessity must be demonstrated on the basis of the infrastructure hierarchy; it must be in line with climate energy efficiency and environmental objectives; it must be consistent with long-term EU energy policy (allowing flexible and multifunctional application and avoiding lock-in effects); it must offer a good cost-benefit ratio and cost efficiency; and finally, it must be technically sound.

The Commission has structured its energy infrastructure priorities for 2020 and beyond, and set out the necessary characteristics for creating an integrated European energy network. I am voting for this report because I understand that there is a need to set out an integrated European approach to new energy infrastructure that enables the development of common European systems, the reduction of disparities between energy supply and demand, the promotion of increased cooperation between Russia, Belarus and the Baltic States, and contribution to energy consumption that is more rational and sustainable. I should like to stress the importance attached to the 'Intelligent Cities' partnership for innovation, to the Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas (Jessica) and European Local Energy Assistance (ELENA) programmes, and to the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI), which will contribute to an 80-95% cut in EU greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In the regional context, the report contributes to eliminating socio-economic and environmental disparities between the various Member States, and enables the regions to launch projects for investing in a number of areas. I would also stress that the EU needs to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, whose integration with the European energy network will be difficult: the specific situation of the outermost regions' energy systems should be included in the energy infrastructure priorities for 2020.

The European Union requires legislation that encourages the creation and development of such infrastructure, because that would help to eliminate existing barriers to providing energy security and energy efficiency, encourage the diversification of energy delivery, and combine the collective potential and economic opportunities of Member States.
<P>
Both the Treaty of Lisbon and the third legislative package for an internal EU gas and electricity market identify the creation of interconnected energy networks as one of the priorities of the EU. The EU must invest the maximum resources available and attract private finance in order to prioritise the development of European energy infrastructure and avoid a future where one provider has a dominant position. We must subordinate the excessively numerous and divergent interests of EU states and overcome the fragmentation in the internal market. The European Union must create a single energy market with a range of energy providers and stable and fundamentally equitable prices for all Member States.

It is important that European added value is demonstrated in every project and that all projects meet the clearly defined criteria.

Social services of general interest make a very significant contribution in terms of jobs, accounting for 9.6% of EU employment, economic activity and quality of life for the citizens of the Union. Hitherto, European legislation on these services has been partial, dealing only with aspects relating to the right to compete, and inconsistent, being subject to various interpretations by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) and the Commission.
<P>
As well as providing a secure and flexible framework for these services, it is also important to approach them from an economic and political perspective. Indeed, our societies have chosen to establish social institutions that protect citizens against the vicissitudes of the market. Since there are as many programmes implementing these services as there are Member States of the Union, the report takes a pragmatic view, which is particularly coherent given this vast subject. Defending the model of a social market economy whose social services of general interest are essential tools, I voted in favour of this report.

Access to services of general interest is a fundamental right included in the economic, social and cultural rights recognised in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. These services, especially access to those supporting the care of children, the elderly and other dependants, are essential for ensuring the equal participation of women and men in the labour market, education and vocational training. This report identifies opportunities for addressing the concerns of providers and users of social services of general interest and also identifies the policy and legislation which could be developed to ensure that social services of general interest, both economic and non-economic, are able to play their normal role, while helping us exit the crisis and implement the 2020 social and economic strategy.

I strongly support its final aims to identify and find solutions to the problems faced by users and providers of social services of general interest. We need to prevent the current financial and economic crisis from putting the development of social services of general interest at risk. In the long term this would harm the growth of employment, the increase in fiscal contributions and the aggregate consumption. It seems also urgent, as stressed by the report, to conduct an assessment of the social consequences and impact on people's lives of liberalisation measures in sectors that are essential to social progress (transport, energy, water, postal services, telecommunications, etc.). The Commission should prevent any further liberalisation measures from being taken until this assessment has been submitted.

To be perfectly honest, I am somewhat disappointed by the final outcome of the vote on this report, which seems to me to lack clarity. The subject, however, is important: social services of general interest (SSGIs) play a major role in our society and should not be overlooked. However, in my view, the European approach to this issue lacks both political ambition and legal clarity. On this latter point, I drafted an opinion on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs calling on the European Commission to clarify the rules on state aid for SSGIs. I am pleased that the Commission has since chosen this path. On the subject of political ambition, I believe that the EU needs to define more precisely what it means by 'social services of general interest' and the policy it wishes to apply to them. I supported this own-initiative report because, for me, it seemed important to send a signal to the Commission, but I voted against the paragraphs and amendments I felt were confusing or inappropriate.

in writing. - (LT) The crisis has resulted in enormous economic and social costs, including economic stagnation, large increases in unemployment and poverty. Current Council and Commission policy is to emphasise fiscal consolidation - the restoration of the debt and budget deficit criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact. The debate about how to address these problems is also about how we save the European social model from fatal damage. The Treaty on European Union acknowledges that services of general economic interest (SGEI) are an intrinsic part of Europe's social model and states clearly the responsibilities of Member States in the delivery of such services, while the European Charter of Fundamental Rights recognises the right of citizens to access SGEI. High quality universal services such as health, education and childcare, and essential network services such as transport, energy and telecommunications, ensure a healthy, active, and harmonious society. They are also essential for higher levels of labour market participation and for the development of a competitive social market economy. I agree with the report's call for the Member States and the Commission to better coordinate their actions in this area and exchange good practice, promoting the further modernisation of social services of general interest (SSGI) in different Member States. I believe that the establishment of a high-level working group could make a significant contribution towards determining existing problems and possible means of addressing them, particularly in terms of identifying European single market rules that are having a negative impact on the provision of SSGI.
<SPEAKER ID="539" NAME="Jean-Luc Bennahmias" LANGUAGE="FR">
As regards the rules adapted to the specificity of social services, meeting in plenary session the European Parliament has recognised the importance of social services of general interest (SSGIs) in the context of the current economic and financial crisis. Creators of social cohesion, these services play a vital role as a shock absorber to cushion the effect of the crisis. While they remain mainly within the competence of the Member States, they often come up against the rules of the internal market, especially state aid rules. Because these rules appear inadequate and do not give enough recognition to the specific characteristics of these public services, we need to work pragmatically on revising them and on strengthening legal certainty. The challenge is to enable public service providers to fully carry out their mission of general interest. Yet the legal vacuum is filled by the Court of Justice, which is neither democratic nor creates legal certainty for the service providers. With today's vote we recognise that SSGIs must benefit from conditions allowing them to carry out their mission to the full extent. We need to make the accessibility, universality, quality and efficiency of these services a priority.

They play a myriad of functions and are one of the main indicators of quality of life. Although often not economic in character, they make a major economic contribution towards job creation, stimulating economic activity and increasing purchasing power, as well as strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion within Europe. For all of these reasons, I welcome the report's idea that, at this time that is difficult for many Member States, both economically and financially, investment in public and social services must not be reduced. On the contrary, given their importance and absolute necessity, such services need to be enhanced. Another issue raised in the report, which the European Parliament urges the Commission to address as a matter of urgency, is that of overcoming shortcomings found in the legal framework for the provision of public services.
<SPEAKER ID="539" NAME="Philippe Boulland" LANGUAGE="FR">
Social services of general interest (SSGIs) are subdivisions of services of general interest (SGIs) and make a very significant contribution in terms of jobs, economic activity and purchasing power by providing aid and services from which the public and private market benefits. I voted in favour of this report, because SSGIs are essential to the proper operation of the European Community. A healthy society and a healthy economy cannot exist without intelligent management of SSGIs in the Member States and, consequently, in the European Union, or without services meeting the needs of citizens and internal market operators. Indeed, this report proposes to the Member States a programme for reforming rules that have become too onerous as regards public procurement and specific aid for SSGIs so as to promote the achievement of EU social goals. The proposals will enable national and local authorities to adopt a more flexible approach in the funding of SSGIs and, therefore, make SSGIs, and the market, more competitive.

I expect an initiating and supporting role from the Commission, including training for regional and local bodies in the implementation of EU regulations relating to SSGIs. In relation to the Communication of 2007, we need to introduce a programme of reforms, including a clarification of this support and recognition of the special non-market nature of SSGIs, in order to ensure full compliance not only with the provisions of the single market, but also with the social obligations contained in the Treaties. The aim should be to create a flexible framework for SSGIs, making use of all the available instruments, in order to ensure that the Union's social objectives do not restrict or even paralyse entrepreneurial activity in the single market.

The economic vision that led to its creation in the beginning is not the only dimension of a political reality that intends to take part in governing globalisation. This contains other dimensions which generate shared visions and policies which have to make people the focus of their attention. This change of approach makes it even more important to encourage the creation of an economic and social context in which the need to develop one's own identity and the response to the fundamental needs of daily life and future prospects are what drive public actions. In this context social services of general interest take on a bigger, different role in which the financial aspect, in terms of budget compatibility and medium- and long-term sustainability, play a important part, but only in the context of the primary objective of developing human beings and quality of life in a family, social, working and institutional sense. I believe that the report adopted supports this view.

The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services. Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative. The horizontal social clause and Article 14 of the Treaty of Lisbon guarantee social rights, especially the right to access services of general interest. The time has come to prove to EU citizens that a social Europe is on its way and to give public services the place they deserve in European law.

As the Treaty on European Union makes clear, the continuous improvement of its peoples' living and working conditions, and their well-being are objectives of the EU and its Member States. I would stress the importance of sustainable development founded on a highly competitive social market economy geared towards supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and aiming at full employment and social progress; on valuing the quality of the environment; on combating social exclusion; on solidarity between generations; on the protection of the rights of the child; on equal access to healthcare; and on the promotion of social justice and protection.

Public services that are universally accessible, regardless of individual financial circumstances, constitute an important social victory, which cannot be separated from the progress civilisation made in Europe over the course of the 20th century as a result of the social struggle by its workers and peoples. They are an integral part of this progress, doors to which were opened in innumerable countries by this struggle. The current threat to these public services is, in truth, a case of society moving backwards. In the EU - which started by changing their name to 'social services of general interest' (SSGIs) - this is the path that has been followed. We agree with the majority of the proposals tabled by the rapporteur.
<P>
However, unacceptable elements relating to the privatisation and liberalisation of SSGIs have been introduced into the report, which we reject. This means that the final resolution includes manifest contradictions, despite having positive aspects and a progressive vision in some areas. However, it lacks the idea that we argue is central to the issue of public services - public ownership and public administration, with the democratic participation of the users of these public services - in areas essential to public welfare, specifically health, education, communication, transport, energy, and so on.
<SPEAKER ID="542" NAME="Ilda Figueiredo" LANGUAGE="PT">
The vote in plenary on this report has devalued the importance of the majority of public services, including social services of general interest (SSGIs), without which there is no social Europe or even social inclusion.
<P>
We therefore call for the policies of liberalisation to be changed to include a genuine policy of social progress, thus ensuring universal access to high-quality public services that pay particular attention to disadvantaged groups, and universal access for everyone regardless of their financial circumstances.
<P>
Therefore, although we agree with the majority of the proposals tabled by the rapporteur, we have not been able to vote in favour, since elements relating to the privatisation and liberalisation of SSGIs have been introduced into the report, which we reject.
<P>
This means that the final resolution includes some contradictions, despite being generally progressive.

in writing. - (SK) Social services of general interest (SSGIs) belong to the category of services of general interest (SGIs), and under the prevailing interpretations are sometimes incorrectly included in the category of 'economic' services. In addition to the features they share with SGIs, SSGIs and their users can also be defined according to several specific characteristics. In addition to health services and generally accessible services, SSGIs also include, on a legal basis, supplementary services provided directly to the individual and fulfilling a preventative role and a role in social cohesion and social inclusion, as well as implementing fundamental social rights. High-quality universal services, such as health, education and childcare services, and basic network services, such as transport, energy supply and telecommunications, ensure a healthy, active, integrated and inclusive society, as well as being important for higher levels of participation in the labour market and for the development of a competitive social market economy. The public bodies involved in the provision of SSGIs, or granting the right to use them, need a clear legal basis for this area. Voluntary organisations and social economy enterprises that provide SSGIs and have few resources and limited management structures may get into financial difficulties again due to bureaucratic requirements. In my opinion, it would therefore be appropriate to propose and draw up a secure and flexible framework for SSGIs, using the instruments we have available, with the aim of ensuring that rules intended for the regulation of commercial enterprises support rather than hold back the social objectives of the EU.
<SPEAKER ID="542" NAME="Bruno Gollnisch" LANGUAGE="FR">
The problem with the European Union is that the notion of public service is totally alien to it. For the European Union, services, the provision of which is commercial and can generate profit, should be subject to competition, preferably global competition. All sectors are potential candidates, even though some unprofitable segments can, and even must, be left in the care of the Member States and taxpayers.
<P>
What the hell, companies exist to make a profit, not to promote solidarity. That is the general philosophy behind this text. Some exceptions, which are highly sensitive when it comes to preserving the good reputation of Brussels bureaucracy, have been made: financing some forms of transport, but solely to make up for their public service obligations; social security, even though people are convinced that private insurance companies would do better for their greatest benefit, and some others.
<P>
In this context, although well intentioned the report by Mr De Rossa resembles a desperate attempt to salvage something from this situation. It is above all for the Member States to define public services, which are not subject to competition law, in line with the needs and traditions of each nation, and to decide how to organise and fund them. The Commission must take note of this.
<SPEAKER ID="542" NAME="Louis Grech" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - Improving the quality of social services is essential if we are to achieve fundamental EU objectives. It is therefore imperative that a strong SSGI framework is provided on a European level. This would serve to support efforts to retain high standards, accessibility and affordability of such services for European citizens. In doing so however, it is important to keep in mind that SSGIs are constantly evolving and must therefore respond to new social, economic, political and technological developments. It is important that any changes in this field respect the competencies and responsibilities of Member States, as these services must be tailored to the needs of individual nations and their citizens. The relationship between Community law and its operation within the internal market, state aid, public procurement and services of general interest should be viewed against the social aims of the European Union and must therefore be properly analysed. The Commission should also provide a clear legal framework, especially in the current economic environment, and any information on the application of EU rules must ensure that services of general interest continue to be capable of fulfilling their purpose of guaranteeing a better quality of life for European citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="543" NAME="Sylvie Guillaume" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted for this report so as to highlight the importance of social services of general interest (SSGIs) for our society and for our economy. They guarantee social cohesion and real equality between all citizens. They also guarantee higher economic efficiency, as they provide services that the market alone, with short-term horizons, does not provide.
<P>
SSGIs thus have special characteristics, which must be recognised. That is why they should benefit from a secure legal framework, especially against a background of austerity measures linked to the economic crisis, which may call them into question. While current EU texts advocate solidarity and the defence of the service provided to users, they are all too often just words.
<P>
Finally, this report proposes a way forward, starting with the establishment of a high-level, multi-stakeholder working group tasked with identifying and finding solutions to problems facing providers and users of SSGIs. It is a step in the right direction and is therefore to be welcomed.

The working group could consider the relative merits of establishing a European Observatory or Resource Centre for social services of general interest (SSGI) to collect information from various sources in the Member States and to enable the exchange of good SSGI practice at national, regional and local levels, and seek to achieve broad consensus on steps to clarify legal obscurities and ambiguities regarding SSGI. I believe that it is necessary to examine how the Member States, when defining social services of general interest, can take account of gender-specific services, especially advisory and social services particularly designed for women and important services that contribute to women's quality of life and equality, such as health services, particularly sexual and reproductive health services, education and the care of dependents. There is a need to promote innovations such as a Member State register of SSGI, a pilot scheme on care for the elderly, and action programmes based on the voluntary European Quality Framework. The working group should also consider how Member States can develop forms of home help including support for elderly and vulnerable persons, provided by both men and women, and reduce the negative impact on employment and pensions for those who take care of dependent family members.

in writing. - (RO) This motion for a European Parliament resolution on the future of social services of general interest is important because, first and foremost, access to services of general interest is a fundamental right recognised in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. The studies conducted by Eurofound (European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions) highlight that social services of general interest significantly enhance EU citizens' quality of life and ensure their full inclusion in society, which is a key pillar of the European social model and of the way in which European societies are organised. The importance of this report has already been highlighted as well by the fact that it identifies new approaches to social services of general interest, based on the issues identified by providers and users, indicating the need for urgent solutions due to the economic crisis and rising unemployment.
<SPEAKER ID="545" NAME="David Martin" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - In the rapporteur's view a reform package should include a Framework Regulation for SGEI1 using Article 14 TFEU to define services of general interest and delimit the impact of single market rules. The regulation could distinguish between economic and non-economic SGI, and consolidate and clarify the general principles and common conditions for the successful operation of these services. However the political configuration of the Council and the Commission makes it unlikely that such legislative can be adopted in the near future, and solutions are required now. I support this.
<SPEAKER ID="545" NAME="Clemente Mastella" LANGUAGE="IT">
High-quality universal services such as health, education and childcare, and essential network services such as transport, energy and telecommunications, ensure a healthy, active, cohesive and inclusive society. This is why social services of general interest (SSGI), which are essential economic and social pillars of our society, should be adequately funded by the European Union.
<P>
Taken together they make a major contribution in terms of jobs, economic activity and purchasing power. In view of the current economic crisis and unemployment, we believe that more than ever citizens need to be able to access high-quality social services of general interest, just as our economies and our societies need the benefits that such services can offer.
<P>
Therefore, we believe that we need a greatly enhanced EU budget, a greater role for the European Investment Bank (EIB), and a high-level multi-stakeholder taskforce supported by the Recommendations of the 3rd Biennial Forum on SSGI. Among other things, the reforms need to deal with the role of enterprises, social economy actors and volunteer organisations in the delivery of SSGI, and obligatory compliance with national and local social and quality criteria in procurement contracts.
<SPEAKER ID="545" NAME="Nuno Melo" LANGUAGE="PT">
One of the EU's main objectives is to continuously improve its peoples' living and working conditions, and their well-being. This objective can only be achieved through the sustainable development of a Europe based on balanced economic growth; on a highly competitive social market economy geared towards supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and aiming at full employment and social progress; on the protection and improvement of the environment; on combating social exclusion, discrimination and inequalities in access to health care; on promoting social justice and protection; on equality between women and men; on solidarity between generations; and on the protection of the rights of the child. Social services of general interest (SSGIs) are essential to realising these ambitious objectives. As a result, only the provision of universally available, high-quality, accessible and affordable SSGI, within the meaning of the 2007 Commission communication on SSGIs, can therefore be regarded as an essential pillar of the European social model, and as the basis for a good quality of life and for the achievement of EU employment, social and economic objectives.

According to the report, a series of countries assumed the role of service providers while, in fact, they do not meet their responsibilities. Besides creating a working group, it is necessary to compile a list of Member States which, in exchange for a social guarantee, cynically deceive their citizens.

Each Member State must have accessible, affordable and high-quality social services. It is very important for the Member States to increase the potential for employment and growth in the social, health and education services sectors to guarantee EU citizens decent, non-discriminatory working conditions and access to comprehensive social protection systems. Moreover, an effective support mechanism needs to be established for enterprises providing social services. The application of public-private partnerships should be extended, and rules and public procurement procedures need to be simplified. Attention should be drawn to the fact that social workers must encourage EU citizens to work, study, and engage in economic activity, in order to gain independence and satisfy their needs. I believe that a European Observatory or Resource Centre for SSGIs will enable Member States to exchange best practice at national, regional and local levels, and encourage more effective territorial cooperation between regions.

I voted for this report on the future of social services of general interest (SSGIs). SSGIs encompass statutory and complementary social security schemes and universally available services provided directly to the person, aiming to enhance the quality of life of all. These services play a preventative, social cohesion and inclusion role, and deliver fundamental rights, as proclaimed in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
<P>
There is a broad European consensus that SSGIs are essential to the well-being of our peoples and an efficient economy, and that while there has been some progress in addressing the difficulties that arise for providers in the delivery and development of SSGI from the application of EU rules to such services, there is no consensus so far within or between the Commission and the Council on the implementation of further practical measures to overcome the obstacles identified by stakeholders. This report aims to find measures to ensure that social objectives are achieved and not harmed by the application of single market rules.

High quality universal services such as health, education and childcare, and essential network services such as transport, energy and telecommunications are also essential for higher levels of labour market participation and for the development of a competitive, social market economy.
<P>
The European Commission and the Member States have to support initiatives which help bring about a more social and green policy agenda by encouraging the European Commission to publish a guide on social procurement. It is important to support the development of a European voluntary quality framework for SSGI which could be used as a basis for developing sector-specific quality frameworks to meet the needs of different types of social services (emergency, residential, childcare, disability, social housing, etc). The Member States should encourage employment creation and the growth potential of the social, health and education services sector by offering migrants and EU citizens decent working conditions and access to comprehensive social protection systems.

in writing. - I strongly support this report on social services of general interest (SSGIs), and congratulate my colleague Proinsias De Rossa for having managed to bring new political momentum to a neglected dimension of European integration. Social services of general interest, such as health services, care services for children, the elderly or other dependents, and other universally available services, are an essential part of the European social model. They play a key role in social cohesion and inclusion and in the realisation of the social rights recognised by the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, they are faced with a number of constraints and with legal uncertainty, as the application of EU rules on the functioning of the single market, on public procurement and on state aids impinges upon their normal operation. The European Court of Justice has been called upon to adjudicate on this tension. There is an overwhelming stakeholder consensus on the need for Commission action to address these problems. The weakening of SSGIs through austerity measures is a false economy, as demonstrated by their role as automatic stabilisers which cushioned the impact of the crisis for the most vulnerable members of European societies. More than ever, we need affordable, universally available and good quality SSGIs.
<SPEAKER ID="546" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
The relative trust regarding provision of social services of general interest (SSGIs) has declined in recent years. The recent economic crisis has demonstrated that the Member States have a certain amount of structural fragility, leading to a generalised suspicion about their financial capacity for guaranteeing the provision of a huge range of social services to the public. Therefore, things that were not long ago considered secure are now under threat, making it necessary to find new solutions in order to continue offering a development model supported by respect for human dignity. Irrespective of the solution found, there are some things that should be viewed as certain: SSGIs are of great economic significance; it should not just be national governments responsible for their provision, but also associations, companies with a social focus and even private enterprise; and it should be ensured that the process of setting out priorities in this area will involve the participation of various non-state entities, in order that the most suitable solutions can be found for the proposed goals to be achieved.

In favour. I welcome the vote on the report by Mr De Rossa, which, as my fellow Member, Mrs Delli, has said, reminds us that social services of general interest (SSGIs) are at the heart of the European social model. We would point out that SSGIs are available to everyone and that we should ensure that everyone has access to them, especially with regard to social housing.
<P>
The European Parliament also calls on the Commission to propose legislation recognising universal access to basic banking services and to broadband Internet. Finally, we are asking for clarification of the criteria distinguishing between economic and non-economic services, which would provide greater protection for social services.

Unfortunately, while the urgency of the economic and social situation would have required Members to demand a framework legislative tool on SSGIs, as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposed in its alternative resolution, my fellow Members refused to take that courageous initiative.

Services of general interest cover a broad spectrum of activities, ranging from major network undertakings such as energy, telecommunications, transport, audiovisual and postal services to education, water, waste management, social services and health.

These are essential services for the daily life of citizens and companies representing the European model of society. The adoption of this resolution today underlines the fact that these services play an important role in social, economic and territorial cohesion throughout the European Union. They are fundamental for the sustainable development of the EU in terms of higher employment, social integration, economic growth and environmental quality.

<SPEAKER ID="548" NAME="Czesław Adam Siekierski" LANGUAGE="PL">
I regard this issue as extremely significant. Social services, including assistance for weaker economies, are among the European Union's fundamental duties. Assistance for less affluent regions embodies the spirit of solidarity and is in the interest of the EU as a whole. Subsidising poorer areas makes it possible for them to develop more rapidly, for many new jobs to be created and for us to exit the crisis we are currently experiencing much more rapidly. Support for poor people will allow them to feel that they have not been rejected. This programme makes a significant contribution to the fight against poverty, and extending its budget would represent major progress in the fight against the crisis. Financial assistance for the most deprived allows them to gain more qualifications and helps them to find a way out of the unfortunate situation in which they currently find themselves. It motivates them to take further action and improve themselves. The universal services we are discussing here, such as education, health care, transport, energy and telecommunications, guarantee that EU society will be cohesive, healthy, well-educated and thus politically and professionally active, and they translate into a higher percentage of well-educated workers on the market, which in turn results in the growth of a competitive social market economy, making it possible to fight the crisis and subsequently to achieve economic growth.

They are the expression of a social Europe, as they promote the social context and guarantee social inclusion.
<P>
Let me be very clear on this: social services are not solely for the neediest but for all EU citizens. The lack of a clear legal framework gives the Court of Justice full scope to flesh out such services of general interest via case law. This is a bad evolution of events. At the moment, Europe does not want any legislation, while there is a need to seek out resources in order to be able to fund these services adequately and guarantees for employment generating these services.
<P>
Mr De Rossa's report quite rightly criticises these elements and therefore obtained my support. It nonetheless does leave the door open for public-private partnerships and the privatisation of such services. That is wrong, as the liberalisation of telecoms, postal and train services, et cetera, did not lead to better services for an affordable price - quite the contrary, in fact. I therefore gave my full support to the alternative resolution from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance calling for separate legislation for these social services, thereby putting a truly social Europe first.
<SPEAKER ID="549" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Social services of general interest (SSGIs) are a crucial pillar of the European social model, ensuring social, economic and territorial cohesion, and simultaneously making an important contribution to the economy in terms of jobs, economic activity and the well-being of the European public. As well as aiming to promote legal certainty and impose flexibility, this report has the principal objective of demonstrating the need to modernise SSGIs, with a focus on their accessibility, universality, fairness and effectiveness, and it pays particular attention to more disadvantaged people. It should be mentioned that the cuts made necessary by the sovereign debt crisis should not threaten the development of SSGIs, particularly those relating to support for children and older people, for education, for health, and for essential network services, which act as a powerful force for social inclusion and poverty reduction. I agree that the principle of subsidiarity should be applied in this specific case, since it is national, regional and local entities that know the reality as regards provision of SSGIs. However, I would stress that the EU should make efforts to modernise and adapt SSGIs to the scale of the European social model, which itself needs to be rethought.

I abstained during the final vote, because the right-leaning majority in the European Parliament diluted the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. The European Parliament resolution recognises the special features of social services of general interest (SSGIs) and underscores the continuing legal uncertainty surrounding them, their universal character, their stabilisation function in response to this crisis, and so on. It also calls for the creation of a high-level multi-stakeholder working group, the remit of which should be to identify the problems encountered by providers and users of SSGIs and to come up with appropriate solutions.

The resolution also calls for an evaluation of measures to liberalise public services, including network services, whose impact on our citizens we will assess continually. The majority in the European Parliament distorted the report by removing the request to put an end to policies to liberalise public services. It also removed the part supporting the revision of public procurement rules and the request to recognise alternatives to public procurement for the delivery of Services of General Interest (SGIs), including SSGIs. This is a step backwards. The final text urges us to step up our efforts to bring about the full recognition of SSGIs.

The health care and social services sector accounts for 5% of economic output and employs around 21.4 million people. The European Centre of Employers and Enterprises providing Public Services (CEEP) estimates that providers of SGIs contribute 26% (EUR 2 423 billion) of EU GDP and employ 64 million people. We urgently need reform programmes and a clear legal basis for SSGIs in order to respond positively to the difficulties relating to the rules for awarding contracts and state aid.

However, it is also important to help developing countries to build efficient and transparent taxation policies, improve accountability, and strengthen national parliaments' and civil society organisations' commitment to the development agenda. In order to obtain the best results, the EU should concentrate on initiatives focused on creating economic growth and involving the private sector in the least-developed countries.

It must be ensured that growth is not biased and EU policies must benefit the poorest in the world. The microcredit, microfinance and other similar schemes are important tools for this purpose. Strong property rights must be established, and the illegal seizure of land and speculation in feedingstuffs eliminated in order to strengthen the ability of local resources to ensure the safety of the food supply.

Against the background of global economic contraction, social insensitivity and an increasingly clear trend towards national preservation, EU development policy may prove to be the sign of solidarity that we all need. However, I think that at a time when there is increasingly frequent talk about the concept of 'inclusive growth', the term needs to be clarified. We must also identify a number of clear mechanisms and courses of action which will guarantee this kind of development. I concur, along with the rapporteur, that one of these courses of action may feature in the industrial potential of developing countries. Since we must not be completely indifferent to which strategic areas funds are being allocated to, I believe that, in future, strong emphasis must be placed on conducting social impact assessments on the results generated by these programmes. It may become clear in some states that agriculture has increased potential for eradicating poverty. Just as in the case of other beneficiaries, the reality on the ground will show us that the solution lies in supporting domestic industry.

The text calls on the Commission to formulate a comprehensive assessment policy based on clear-cut criteria and indicators. In addition to this it urges the EU institutions and Member States to monitor and report on governance practices in developing countries (including fighting corruption, improving public financial management, enhancing transparency and upholding human rights).

I agree that the European Country Strategy must be developed in order to achieve better coordination between the Commission and the Member States. The EU's development policy should aim at eliminating obstacles to development, such as dumping of agricultural products, illegitimate debt burdens, capital flight and unfair trade, and at creating an international environment conducive to fighting poverty, guaranteeing decent incomes and livelihoods and to the fulfilment of basic human rights, including social and economic rights.

There is also a need to tackle inequality, including gender inequality, because gender equality, women's political and economic empowerment and women's enjoyment of human rights are essential for poverty reduction and sustainable development. At the same time, it is important to raise public awareness of this and efforts must be made to improve the transparency of aid spending, enhance the dissemination of independent evaluation studies and impose stricter sanctions on those actors who have been found to be misappropriating development aid.

In this regard, efforts need to be concentrated on the concept of 'democratic ownership', a key approach that involves investments promoting good governance, greater democracy and human rights, and the fight against corruption. The development assistance process should see more active involvement on the part of the private sector, in particular of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are widespread and vital for sustainable development and for achieving the objectives that have been set.
<P>
Finally, the focus should be on industrial development, which has tremendous transformative potential for national economies and, unlike agricultural exports or natural resources extraction, is likely to offer enhanced scope for long-term productivity growth.

in writing. - There is a lack of transparency and public acceptance in development projects funded fully or partially by the EU. It is up to Member States to decide whether they are willing to support developing countries using taxpayers' money, and not through some EU charity created to bring positive publicity to the EU and creating worldwide EU foreign affairs policy. EU development policy simply shows that the EU wants to replace national states on the global stage.
<SPEAKER ID="553" NAME="Carlos Coelho" LANGUAGE="PT">
The future of European Union development policy will involve the immediate restructuring of development policy to make it more consistent, focused on poverty eradication and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), on respect for human rights, and on establishing synergies between the various political actors and projects. Although, in the last decade, and above all since the adoption of the European Consensus on Development, the EU has doubled public development aid and improved the ways aid is delivered, I share the concerns expressed in this report that Parliament has been putting forward: in particular, meeting the financial commitments already made, the consistency of development policy, regular monitoring and assessment, and the projects and challenges resulting from the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS).
<P>
I do not wish to fail to stress that, although economic growth is a crucial factor in development, it is not exclusively in poverty eradication and promotion of social cohesion. Investment in democracy; in human development, such as education, health, freedom of expression, and so on; in food security; and in climate change is key to the success of a genuine policy of sustainable development.
<SPEAKER ID="553" NAME="Corina Creţu" LANGUAGE="RO">
The time is right for a wide-ranging EU-level debate on the future of EU development policy. It is important that the EU defines its vision, ambitions, objectives and appropriate instruments, before deciding about the place of development aid in the forthcoming multiannual financial framework. What is required is better coordination, an increase in the impact of aid without reducing its quantity, more active involvement from the private sector, as well as the promotion of inclusive growth and measures to combat poverty.
<P>
Special attention must also be focused on the root causes of food insecurity in developing countries, which is a fundamental problem in the context of the global recession and food crisis. This is actually also a consequence of the reduction in ODA spending for agriculture from 17% in 1980 to 5% today, and of this sector being neglected by donors for many years.
<SPEAKER ID="553" NAME="Mário David" LANGUAGE="PT">
Following the publication of the Commission Green Paper, I agree with most of the ideas introduced by this own-initiative report on the future of EU development policy, both because of its in-depth analysis of already existing policies, and - mainly - because of the stress it places on the need to increase its impact on the current socio-economic situation. The report proposes making development cooperation policy more effective by analysing seven areas of activity: seven fundamental directions that I believe cover the areas key to the success of these policies. By way of example, I would stress the crucial importance given to human development by increasing support for basic social services like education and health. That is the only way they will earn Official Development Assistance (ODA), thus promoting real and sustained development. I would also stress the importance of private sector involvement as a means of creating new jobs and promoting the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). I believe this report stands out because of the objectives identified, which I consider well presented, joined-up and complementary: they provide for the maximisation of the positive impact of these policies on the people at whom they are directed.
<SPEAKER ID="553" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
The European Union cannot neglect to regularly assess the impact of its development cooperation and how it could improve its results. The ways we contribute to the development of third countries should be understood in the same way as the process of European integration: evolving and, by its very nature, unfinished. Models that are too closed run the risk of losing touch with reality and not producing the desired effects.
<P>
Without clearly setting out the instruments available and what objectives it intends to achieve with them, the European Union will lack unity of purpose and a sense of mission, which are so necessary in order to help others help themselves. There is no point in focusing action in just the countries most used to receiving aid and abandoning others to increasing problems. Europe should seek imaginative ways of linking countries' political development to their economic and social development. Establishing a European Endowment for Democracy could be an instrument for heading in that direction.
<SPEAKER ID="553" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
The social cohesion and the balanced and sustainable development of the European Union clearly require us to strive for poverty eradication. EU financial assistance should be geared towards helping developing countries become economically independent, sustained by efficient and transparent fiscal policies, and strengthened by the involvement of democratic political institutions and civil society in decision-making and development processes.
<P>
For the sake of the greater efficiency and success of the resources made available in terms of public development aid, this report's recommendations should be followed, particularly as regards the need to improve coordination mechanisms, to ensure regular monitoring and assessment of projects, and to meet the financial commitments already made and address the challenges resulting from the creation of the European External Action Service (EEAS). I would also stress the importance of ensuring that the development policies advocated inside and outside the Union are consistent with each other, with particular reference to the Europe 2020 strategy.

The subject and scale of this report are useful for tackling innumerable relevant issues. However, as usual, there are many areas where it is lacking, incongruous or even contradictory.

in writing. - (SK) In order to boost the impact of EU development policy, the Commission has proposed three criteria for the selection of activities: (1) added value, (2) EU prior coordination, and (3) potential of leverage on reforms and/or other funding sources. Parliament has always called for better coordination, and therefore we can only support efforts to draw up strategic documents for individual EU countries. We should, however, support the Commission in all the efforts it makes to implement in full its coordinating role set out in the Treaty of Lisbon. Coordination and harmonisation should be improved from the perspective of accountability. The incorporation of the European Development Fund (EDF) into the EU budget would be a significant step towards achieving better coordination between EU development aid instruments. The focus on achieving a major impact must not lead to a cautious development policy concentrating only on the 'easy countries'. Need must remain the key criterion. EU development aid should continue to be focused on the poorest countries and the poorest levels of society. In my opinion, a well-developed administration is essential for the positive impact of development, and the EU has considerable experience in supporting political reforms while implementing its aid programmes. Also important for this policy is an approach to administration which emphasises human rights, democracy and the rule of law, the fight against corruption and the role of parliaments and civil society in ensuring the accountability of governments and assessing the results of development.

The main aim of the report is to focus EU development policy again on encouraging inclusive growth.

I welcomed this document, because it proposes maintaining the same level of financing, but through new mechanisms or new methods. The EU should also define its vision, its ambitions, objectives and appropriate instruments on some of the issues raised in the Commission's Green Paper on EU Development policy in support of inclusive growth and sustainable development. I welcome efforts to develop European Country Strategy documents in order to achieve better coordination between the Commission and the Member States. The programming process must ensure that the aid effectiveness agenda is implemented, and that Parliament's right to exercise democratic scrutiny, as defined by the Treaty of Lisbon in Article 290, is respected. Poverty reduction and eradication is the EU's primary development policy objective, as defined by the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Consensus on Development reaffirms the EU's commitment to poverty eradication and the pursuit of the Millennium Development Goals, and to principles such as ownership and partnership, aid effectiveness and policy coherence for development, which continue to be crucial and should guide efforts to enhance the impact of EU development aid. Poverty has multiple dimensions, not just economic, but also human, socio-cultural, political, protective, and environmental, which all need to be tackled by EU development policy.

Faced with a financial crisis in Europe, it is all too tempting to decrease or even abandon our commitments. However, if we followed that path, we would only make the crisis worse. Today, we see ever increasing waves of economic migrants coming to Europe. They come because they cannot build a quality life for themselves in their countries of origin. Without development aid, this would only increase further. It is fully in our interest to help these nations to develop, as it means more trade with Europe, more sharing of information and greater mutual understanding. Development aid is also crucial for the realisation of our goal of promoting democracy. However, it has to be targeted properly and focus on development, not merely support. We must honour our commitments to the Millennium Development Goals. Thank you.

<P>
I agree with the need for high-impact aid, which is the inevitable objective of inclusive growth, as also reiterated by the EU 2020 strategy, and the involvement of the private sector in the development process.

The main objective of development policy is to reduce the level of poverty. Poverty affects people in many ways, and is closely linked to the problem of social exclusion, inter alia in terms of gender equality. Women earn less than men and more frequently have part-time and temporary employment contracts. Almost one in four women in the EU live in poverty, most of whom are older women, single mothers, disabled women and women belonging to ethnic minorities. Another huge problem is violence against women, which is undoubtedly a factor that causes poverty due to its negative impact on health. If we want to implement an effective EU development policy, we must ensure that it takes the gender perspective into account at all possible levels, and therefore I voted in favour of the Kaczmarek report on increasing the impact of EU development policy.

The future shape of the EU aid policy and the role of the Commission, rather than the Member States, will be at the centre. In evaluating the Commission proposals, we have a clear benchmark, which is Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). The primary objective of EU aid must be the reduction and, in the long term, the eradication of poverty. The European Consensus on Development also provides important common values, such as human rights and democracy, and common principles, such as ownership and partnership, which are still valid.

Important for this policy is an approach to governance which puts an emphasis on human rights, democracy and the rule of law, on fighting corruption and on the role of parliaments and civil society in holding governments accountable and in assessing development results.
<P>
Growth is an important driver of development. It should be environmentally sustainable, respect biodiversity and prevent the worrying degradation of fertile land. The EU should therefore promote agro-ecological and low-external-input practices. We also support the importance of the build-up of social security systems and fair tax systems as well as promotion of the decent work agenda of the International Labour Oranisation (ILO).
<P>
Finally, we believe that access to social services, in particular to health and education, must remain a cornerstone of EU aid. Therefore, a modern European development policy needs the understanding and involvement of European citizens, which will require continued efforts on development education and awareness raising, based on values of human rights, democracy, tolerance, social responsibility and gender equality.

The ECR Group would certainly consider a financial transactions tax (FTT) at global level if it could ensure reasonable and equitable contributions from the main donors. However, the S&D Group tabled a RCV to this paragraph, which removed the phrase 'at global level', thus implying that the FTT should only apply at European level.
<P>
The ECR Group disagrees with this. We believe that would unrealistic to have such a tax at European level, as it would jeopardise development aid and unfairly burden European states. The ECR Group also voted against paragraph 79, which identifies one of the 'root causes of food insecurity' as 'food-price speculation'. It is not food-price speculation per se that causes food insecurity, rather the abuses or excesses of speculation. Indeed, speculation itself is a vital part of the farming industry. Nonetheless, we voted in favour of this report as it calls for a more pragmatic approach to EU development aid, calling for measures to ensure transparency and create a more results-based agenda.

Official Development Assistance (ODA) is necessary and must under no circumstances be reduced. There is no justification for not honouring our commitments to reserve 0.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) to ODA. However, the quality of the implementation, management and use of ODA to maximise its impact in terms of growth and poverty reduction must be improved.
<P>
Official Development Assistance represents more than USD 120 billion. Doing more and doing better goes beyond an increase in resources. I am in favour of 'more' general or sectoral budget support and fewer projects when macroeconomic and governance criteria allow this. If a country qualifies for 30% of budget support, why should it not qualify for 90%?

It should be recognised that, beyond the fragmentation and proliferation of stakeholders, the international community must rise to a new challenge: that of the metamorphosis of support. It should be recognised that there coexist, alongside Paris and Accra, other kinds of relationships, other ways of doing and acting, which must now be taken into consideration.

I agree with the fact that the main purpose of EU aid is to reduce and, in time, eradicate poverty. European consensus on development also provides important common values, like human rights and democracy.

In order for the Union to have a development policy, both the proposed objectives and the areas of intervention need to be clearly and incisively envisaged.

Combating the causes of poverty, guaranteeing the provision of essential public services - education and health, in particular - and the so-called 'food security' of populations are also particularly important. There is also a need to boost the private sector by supporting entrepreneurship, so as to encourage wealth creation and the independence of peoples.

The reduction of poverty is the primary objective of EU development policy, as defined by the Treaty of Lisbon. The European Union is also the largest provider of aid to the world's poor countries. This aid is fundamental, and it must have the highest possible impact.

This text, which I support, calls, in particular, for aid to be provided in a predictable manner and for the Member States to keep their promises - even in the context of the economic crisis we are going through. It also calls for projects and policies funded by the European Union to be routinely assessed, though this should not lead to favouring a purely quantitative and short-term assessment of the results, and for the transparency of aid spending to be improved.

Both in Lithuania and the developing world we must increase our efforts to reduce differences in income. Achieving this objective would strengthen the impact of EU aid and poverty would be addressed more efficiently. I agree with the rapporteur that the European Commission's Green Paper on EU development policy devotes too little attention to poverty. Poverty is not simply an economic phenomenon, but also encompasses social, political and cultural deprivation. EU development aid must include this.

The proposed growth strategy involves strengthening the private sector and small and medium-sized businesses. They will be supported using micro-finance which must be aimed in particular at disadvantaged groups, such as minorities, small farmers and women.

The submitted report by Mr Kaczmarek analyses various aspects of European development policy very thoroughly and proposes solutions that will boost the effectiveness of the aid provided. Solidarity between people does not mean giving blindly. Those who give take on a great responsibility. On the one hand, there is the responsibility towards those who need the aid - development aid has a substantial impact on market relations, the rise of elites, the environment and culture in the recipient country. On the other hand, though, there is the responsibility of the EU towards its citizens for the resources provided. Governments do not give their own money, and neither does the Commission. This money comes from the public purse, and it is wealth generated by the people through their work. It is money they have entrusted to the state, and they expect it to be used carefully and sensibly.
