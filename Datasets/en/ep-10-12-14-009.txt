(IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take a few seconds to express my disapproval of the Council's decision to reject the report by Mrs Estrela on maternity leave.
<P>
Today, I am acting as the spokesperson for millions of European mothers and fathers who, like me, are very disappointed by the Council's decision. It is an admission of a lack of values, which I do not identify with and which I condemn with every fibre of my being. I wonder what kind of Europe we are heading towards. Rejecting this proposal is a decision that hurts not just the families of today but, above all, the families of tomorrow.
<SPEAKER ID="120" NAME="President">
We shall now proceed to the vote.
<P>
