<CHAPTER ID="014">
Adjournment of the session
<SPEAKER ID="355" NAME="President">
Today, ladies and gentlemen, is a somewhat special day for me because, after ten years of good and loyal service, this was my last session in the chair here in Brussels.
<P>
It is therefore with a twinge of sorrow that I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.
<P>
(The sitting was closed at 1 p.m.)
