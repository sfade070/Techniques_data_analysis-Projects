<CHAPTER ID="006-35">
35. A European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy (vote) 
<P>
Before the vote on Amendment 10:
<SPEAKER ID="130" NAME="Claude Turmes" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
Mr President, in this amendment, one phrase was deleted from the original text which I believe is important - it is supported by the Socialists and the Liberals - and which reads as follows: 'strengthening laws with regard to competition policies'. We should add that. It then makes more sense to vote for the whole paragraph.
<P>
(The oral amendment was not accepted)
