9. Lisbon Strategy (European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007) (vote) 
<SPEAKER ID="146" NAME="Stephen Hughes" AFFILIATION="PSE">
Mr President, it is a very straightforward oral amendment. In the second line there is a phrase beginning 'have made it clear that no source of energy must be left unused'. We want to insert three words so it would read, 'have made it clear that no sustainable and safe source of energy must be left unused'.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
