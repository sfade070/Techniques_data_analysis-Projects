- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="078" NAME="Philip Bushill-Matthews" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Mr President, I have a small point concerning Amendment 1, which I tabled as shadow rapporteur on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. That was correct, but I should have also said that the original author was Professor Trakatellis. I apologise to him for not including his name. I would hope that the inclusion of his authorship will encourage wider-spread approval across this House for a good amendment.
