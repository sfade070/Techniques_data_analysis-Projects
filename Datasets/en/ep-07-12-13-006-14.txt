- Motion for a resolution
<SPEAKER ID="102" NAME="President">
Before we proceed to the vote on the last report, allow me to dedicate this last vote to a fellow Member who will be leaving us in a few days' time and who has done a wonderful job for us here, at the European Parliament, and for the whole of Europe. It is, of course, Jean-Louis Bourlanges.
<P>
(Applause)

Mr Bourlanges, I hope that the warmth of this applause tells you, more than any speech, how much we will miss you. We wish you all the best.
