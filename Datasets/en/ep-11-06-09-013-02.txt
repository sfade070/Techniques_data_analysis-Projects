2. Guant√°namo: imminent death penalty decision (
<SPEAKER ID="296" NAME="Marie-Christine Vergiat" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
(FR) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I apologise for intervening in this vote. I would just like to ask for Amendment 9 to be placed in paragraph 7 and not in paragraph 4.
<P>
I think there has been a mistake. Amendment 9 concerns the right to a fair trial and, if it is adopted - which would surprise me, but anyway - that would mean that Amendment 12, which is about another topic altogether, will fall.
