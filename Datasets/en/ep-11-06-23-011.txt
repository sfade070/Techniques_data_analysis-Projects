(EL) Madam President, I should like, both personally and on behalf of my colleagues, Mr Kósa, Mrs Wikström, Mr Howitt and Mrs Lichtenberger, to thank everyone who supported the written declaration which we tabled, in the belief that the blind and hard of hearing are entitled to live independently and to participate fully in society. We hope that this initiative will lay the foundations for further and immediate action in this direction and thank you all.
