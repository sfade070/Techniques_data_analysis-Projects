<SPEAKER ID="107" NAME="Robert Goebbels" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(FR) Mr President, I would ask you to wait a little while longer because many Members are still stuck in the lifts. Someone had the extraordinary idea of repairing the lifts during the one week of the month in which we are in Strasbourg, when it could be done in the other three.
<SPEAKER ID="108" NAME="President">
Mr Goebbels, it is already after 12.00. We have already been waiting for five minutes. I think that we can proceed to the vote.
<P>
(Applause)
