- After the vote on Amendment 1
<SPEAKER ID="089" NAME="Robert Goebbels" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(FR) Mr President, I have a feeling that you have held a vote on the Caspary report, and the amendment tabled by my group has been rejected. I myself voted against, because I was on the voting list for the previous report. I believe that we should vote again on the Caspary report, for which there was just one amendment, and then not hold the final vote.
<P>
(Parliament approved the request by Mr Goebbels to hold the vote again)
