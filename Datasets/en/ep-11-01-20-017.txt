<SPEAKER ID="413" NAME="Robert Sturdy" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, we have just had two roll-call votes. This morning before lunch, we had only two roll-call votes. It is the ruling in this Parliament that you have to vote over 50% of the time, and 50% of the roll-call votes, to ensure that you get a full day's pay. Is this correct in this case, or what is the situation?
<SPEAKER ID="414" NAME="President">
It is correct. You have to be present 50% of the time.
