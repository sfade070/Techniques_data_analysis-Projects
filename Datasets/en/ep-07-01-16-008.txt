<CHAPTER ID="008">
Election of Quaestors of Parliament
<SPEAKER ID="047" NAME="President">
The next item on the agenda is the election of the Quaestors of the European Parliament.
<P>
I have received notice of the following candidacies:
<P>
Mia de Vits
<P>
Szabolcs Fazakas
<P>
Ingo Friedrich
<P>
Astrid Lulling
<P>
Jan Mulder
<P>
James Nicholson
<P>
The candidates have informed me that they each accept their nomination as candidates.
<P>
As the number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacancies, I propose that they be elected by acclamation in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, albeit with their seniority then being determined by an electronic vote.
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
I therefore declare all the candidates elected quaestors of the European Parliament, again congratulating all these Members on their election and wishing us good cooperation in the Bureau.
<P>
We will now proceed to determine the quaestors' seniority by secret electronic ballot. Since all we need to do is to determine their seniority, this vote does not require a qualified majority.
<P>
- Following the vote:
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen,
<P>
I now present the result of the vote for the quaestors.
<P>
Votes cast: 669
<P>
Void or invalid voting slips: 16
<P>
Valid votes: 653.
<P>
The votes were cast as follows:
<P>
James Nicholson: 334 votes
<P>
Astrid Lulling: 298 votes
<P>
Mia De Vits: 285 votes
<P>
Ingo Friedrich: 280 votes
<P>
Szabolcs Fazakas: 267 votes
<P>
Jan Mulder: 265 votes
<P>
In accordance with Rules 15 and 14(2) of the Rules of Procedure, the Quaestors rank in order of the votes cast for them.
<P>
Congratulations!
<P>
That means that we can now announce the composition of the new Bureau and the names of the Quaestors to the institutions of the European Communities.
