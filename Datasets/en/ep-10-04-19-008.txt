<SPEAKER ID="013" NAME="Elizabeth Lynne" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, I should just like to thank everybody for signing Written Declaration 71 on breast cancer.
<P>
Most of you know that this is the leading cause of death across the EU of women aged between 35 and 59, and we want Member States to set up nationwide screening programmes and breast cancer specialist units among other things.
<P>
I hope that the signing of this written declaration will be another step forward to help to make sure that we have EU-wide action to stop the dire consequences of breast cancer.
<SPEAKER ID="014" NAME="President">
I would like to thank our fellow Member, as well as all of you who signed this declaration.
