<P>
Before the vote on paragraph 79:
<SPEAKER ID="101" NAME="Syed Kamall" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, I would first of all like to apologise to colleagues for this intervention, but I wonder if someone could explain what 'CMO' actually stands for.
<SPEAKER ID="102" NAME="President">
It stands for 'common market organisation', although it will be slightly different in different languages!
