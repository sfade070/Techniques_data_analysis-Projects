<CHAPTER ID="006-04">
4. Parliament's calendar of part-sessions - 2012 (vote) 
<SPEAKER ID="142" NAME="Joseph Daul" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FR) Mr President, yesterday evening, my group discussed amendments that the services have told us are unacceptable. As a result, and following the discussion I had this morning with the heads of delegation and the group leaders, I request that the vote on the calendar be postponed.
<SPEAKER ID="143" NAME="Martin Schulz" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(DE) Mr President, we have had no opportunity to discuss this as a group. I was informed about it by Mr Daul a few minutes ago, during this morning's debate, and I have discussed it with the chairs of other groups, namely Mrs Harms and Mr Verhofstadt. I also want to address this point to my group, as we have not, so far, had the opportunity to discuss this. I believe that, with a postponement, there would be a very good chance of reaching a broad consensus over the calendar for 2012. I therefore believe that we should vote through this postponement today.
<SPEAKER ID="144" NAME="President">
Mr Schulz spoke in favour of Mr Daul's proposal. I will now give the floor to Mr Fox, who is against this proposal.
<SPEAKER ID="145" NAME="Ashley Fox" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, I was in the Chamber on Monday evening when the Green Group asked for a postponement. Mr Daul and Mr Schulz were here and they both voted against that postponement.
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
So what has changed? Is it really some important legal issue, or is the truth that they realise they are in severe danger of losing Amendment No 4 and they want to postpone it so as to apply pressure to members of their own groups?
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
This has nothing to do with the fictitious reason we have been given, and I would urge colleagues to vote against this delay and vote in favour of Amendment No 4.
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="146" NAME="President">
I will put the request to postpone the vote tabled by Mr Daul to the vote.
<P>
(Parliament approved the request to defer the vote)
