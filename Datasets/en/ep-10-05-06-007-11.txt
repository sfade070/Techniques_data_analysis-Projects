<SPEAKER ID="098" NAME="Nicole Kiil-Nielsen" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
(FR) Mr President, as I indicated during the debate, I propose adding the following oral amendment to paragraph 6: 'Calls on the Nigerian authorities to reverse the recent move by some Nigerian state governors to execute death-row inmates to ease overcrowding in prisons, which would constitute a gross violation of human rights; calls on the state governors to exercise restraint and continue the de facto moratorium; recalls that the use of the death penalty is contrary to Nigeria's commitments at international level'.
<SPEAKER ID="100" NAME="Filip Kaczmarek" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(PL) Mr President, the amendment is about making questions of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief the subject of dialogue between the European Union and Nigeria, in the context - and these are the additional words - of political dialogue based on the Cotonou Agreement.
