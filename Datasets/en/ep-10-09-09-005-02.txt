2. Situation of the Roma people in Europe (vote)
<SPEAKER ID="081" NAME="Hannes Swoboda" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
Mr President, I would like to move the following amendment as a new paragraph 9a. I will read it: 'Considers that the situation of Roma in Europe can in no way affect the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen Area, nor the rights of their citizens'. I hope the House can support that amendment.
<SPEAKER ID="083" NAME="Gerard Batten" AFFILIATION="EFD">
Mr President, I notice that there were a large number of people holding up banners. I understand this is against the rules, but you did not say anything about it. If they can hold up their banner, can I hold up mine, please? It reads: 'Say no to the European Union'.
<P>
(Applause from the EFD Group)
<P>
Can we have one set of rules that applies for everybody, please? Is that possible?
<SPEAKER ID="084" NAME="President">
I think you have made your point. Everybody knows and noticed that you say 'no' to the European Union.
