<CHAPTER ID="015">
Order of business
<SPEAKER ID="019" NAME="President">
The final draft agenda for this part-session, as laid down by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting on Thursday 3 April 2008 pursuant to Rules 130 and 131 of the Rules of Procedure, has been distributed. The following amendments have been requested to this draft.
<P>
Thursday:
<P>
The Socialist Group in the European Parliament has requested that the report by Mrs Jäätteenmäki on the Statute of the European Ombudsman be postponed until the next part-session in Strasbourg and that voting time be brought forward to 11 a.m.
<SPEAKER ID="020" NAME="Hannes Swoboda">
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Mr President, that is indeed our wish. This is not because the report is a bad one - I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on behalf of my group, too, on a very good report - but there are still one or two critical issues unresolved. We should like to be able to discuss these in peace, which is the reason for our motion; and, as the President has just said, if the House were to agree to it, we could then vote at 11 a.m. - but this is not the reason.
<P>
Mr President, for form's sake, I should like to notify my fellow Members on this occasion that I shall also be putting forward a motion - not now, but tomorrow - that the vote on the report on FYROM, or Macedonia, likewise be postponed until the Strasbourg sitting. I shall state the reasons for this tomorrow; I just wanted to let my fellow Members know now. Here, too, there is just one small unresolved issue. This is our group's wish.
<SPEAKER ID="021" NAME="President">
Would anyone like to speak in favour of the motion?
<SPEAKER ID="022" NAME="Ingo Friedrich">
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I believe Mr Swoboda's argument was admittedly brief, but it was concise. There are indeed one or two aspects, and therefore I, too, am in favour of postponement.
<SPEAKER ID="023" NAME="President">
Who speaks against the motion?
<SPEAKER ID="024" NAME="Andrew Duff">
on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, the committee agreed the Jäätteenmäki report to strengthen the powers of the Ombudsman by 19 votes in favour to none against.
<P>
It is a question we have discussed for some time. It seems to me now to be quite extraordinary and, indeed, deplorable that the PSE and PPE-DE Groups have acquired cold feet upon the important question of the Ombudsman.
<P>
The transparency of Parliament depends upon improving the Statute of the European Ombudsman. The Presidency is requesting that we fast-track the question for conclusion, and I would strongly urge Parliament to press on with the agenda as agreed.
<P>
(Parliament approved the proposal by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament)
<SPEAKER ID="025" NAME="President">
The order of business is thus adopted.
