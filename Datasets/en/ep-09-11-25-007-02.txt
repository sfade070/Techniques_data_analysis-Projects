rapporteur. - Mr President, briefly, I would just like to thank the Swedish Presidency for the excellent cooperation. I think this agreement is ambitious as well as realistic. It will convince us to opt for fuel efficiency, for low noise and also, of course, for safety. My thanks also go to the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs, Matthias Groote and Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, for the terrific job they have done.
