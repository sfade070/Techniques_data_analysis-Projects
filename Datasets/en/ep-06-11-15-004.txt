Voting time
<SPEAKER ID="078" NAME="President">
Mr Rack has the floor for a point of order.
<SPEAKER ID="079" NAME="Reinhard Rack" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Mr President, if I have understood correctly, the President should preside over the vote. He has more than a dozen deputies. If he is really unable to attend, one of these deputies should at least be present.
<SPEAKER ID="080" NAME="President">
No, Mr Rack. It was I who was responsible for chairing Voting Time. The reason I was slightly late was that I was at the airport receiving the Emir of Qatar, and there was a slight delay on the journey there and back.
<P>
The next item is the vote.
