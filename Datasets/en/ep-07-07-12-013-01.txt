Joint resolution.

- Before the vote on the draft resolution:
<SPEAKER ID="269" NAME="Avril Doyle" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Mr President, on a point of order, before you put the motion for a resolution to the vote, in the interests of fairness I think the ALDE Group should recognise that but for the PPE-DE Group's presence here this afternoon, its amendments would not have been passed. I think there should be consistency in our criticism about presence in this Chamber.
