<P>
- before the vote on Amendment 21:
<SPEAKER ID="077" NAME="Karl von Wogau " LANGUAGE="DE">
Mr President, since an editorial problem has come to light here, I suggest that we deviate from the voting list I proposed and instead vote against Amendment 21.
<P>
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
<P>
- before the vote on Amendment 7:
<SPEAKER ID="079" NAME="Helmut Kuhne" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(DE) Mr President, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has asked me if I might make a small amendment, and I shall be happy to do so, since it would not in any way alter the political thrust. The last line would then read:
<P>
'would welcome the willingness of the United States to join in such negotiations with Iran'.
<P>
(DE) I am therefore happy to do as the Liberals have suggested and amend the text accordingly.
<P>
(Parliament agreed to accept the oral amendment)
