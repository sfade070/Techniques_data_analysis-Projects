<SPEAKER ID="074" NAME="Struan Stevenson" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Mr President, I, too, would like to thank all the Members who signed Written Declaration No 75 on Camp Ashraf. This sends a very powerful message to the Iraqi authorities to lift the inhuman siege that they have applied against the 3 400 innocent people in Camp Ashraf over recent months. I really am grateful that more than half of the Members of this House have signed this declaration. It was only opened a month ago and that is a very rapid victory. Thank you very much indeed.
<P>
(Applause)
