<SPEAKER ID="141" NAME="SaÃ¯d El Khadraoui" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
(NL) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I concur with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs that in order to underline the need for a worldwide agreement on environmental measures within the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a minor amendment of the text is needed. Specifically, reference is made to the outcome of the 61st session of the IMO's Marine Environment Protection Committee a few weeks ago. The following words, which I will quote in English, should be added immediately after this: 'and maintaining its call for further substantial progress within the IMO'.
<SPEAKER ID="142" NAME="President">
Are there any objections? It seems not to be the case so we will proceed with the vote on Amendment 1 by roll-call vote.
