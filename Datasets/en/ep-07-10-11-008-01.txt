1. The humanitarian situation in Gaza (vote) 
<P>
- Motion for a resolution: the humanitarian situation in Gaza
<P>
- Before the vote on paragraph 5:
<SPEAKER ID="085" NAME="Charles Tannock" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Madam President, I would like to add the words 'the State of' before Israel in paragraph 5. The reason for this is that some Members, including Mr Davies, inform me that Hamas recognises Israel, but not the State of Israel. It is the State of Israel that needs recognition.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
