<P>
- Before the vote on paragraph 20:
<SPEAKER ID="084" NAME="Zbigniew Zaleski" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(ES) Mr President, in the event of paragraph 20 not being rejected, I propose an oral amendment:
<P>
'Otherwise, lesser-used languages and less-recognised languages, particularly in Western Europe, of the new Member States, will be left behind with their linguistic social space taken over by the more widely spoken languages, especially English.'
<P>
(Parliament rejected the oral amendment)
