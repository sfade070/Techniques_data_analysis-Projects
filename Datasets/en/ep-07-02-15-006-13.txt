That concludes voting time.
<SPEAKER ID="095" NAME="Tatjana Ždanoka" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
Mr President, on a point of order, at the beginning of voting time we voted on two Esteves reports: the first on readmission, without a roll-call vote, and the second on short-stay visas, with a roll-call vote. However, you announced the same title both times: 'the report on readmission'.
<P>
As a result, there was some confusion in the vote by the Verts/ALE Group. I would like to ask the Secretariat and the President to check our vote. Our group's position was in favour of the report on short-stay visas and against the report on readmission. I am afraid that the whole group has voted otherwise because of the mistake made in the announcement of the title of the report. Please take this into account.
<SPEAKER ID="098" NAME="President">
If this was the case, Mrs Ždanoka, it will be noted. We shall look into it and make the appropriate note in the Minutes.
