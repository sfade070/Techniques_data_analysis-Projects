Mr President, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs has already presented to plenary the reports by Mrs Kudrycka, Mrs Segelstr√∂m and Mr La Russa on the legislative proposals for which the Commission requests use of the urgency procedure. We believe that, from a political point of view, the compromise that we have been able to achieve with the other institutions is acceptable, and we are therefore in favour of plenary adopting these reports during this part-session.
<SPEAKER ID="013" NAME="Ewa Klamt">
on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - (DE) Mr President, I would like to say - speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats - that we are in full agreement with that, and I think that the Members belonging to the other groups in this House will be able to give their consent too.
<P>
