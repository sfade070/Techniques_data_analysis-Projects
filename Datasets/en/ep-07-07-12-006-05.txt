- Barsi-Pataky report
<SPEAKER ID="086" NAME="Rosa MiguÃ©lez Ramos" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(ES) Mr President, this report is still appearing on the monitors as Krahmer, when in fact it is the Barsi-Pataky report. That may create some confusion. It confused me.
<SPEAKER ID="087" NAME="President">
It is correct now. Thank you for drawing my attention to what is happening behind the scenes.
