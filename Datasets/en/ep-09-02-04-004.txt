Priorities in the fight against Alzheimer's disease (written declaration): see Minutes

<SPEAKER ID="087" NAME="Eva-Britt Svensson" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
- (SV) I hope now that the whole of Parliament will listen. During the part-session in January, we unanimously adopted a resolution on the Horn of Africa. It contained a specific paragraph stating that Dawit Isaak should be released. Dawit Isaak is now extremely sick and I would like to ask the President to write to the Eritrean authorities.
<P>
The news of his illness has been confirmed by several sources and has been mentioned in the Swedish media today. The situation is extremely serious and desperate and I would just like to remind you that Dawit Isaak is a Swedish-Eritrean journalist who has been imprisoned without trial since 2001. His health problems are so serious now that he is being kept in a military hospital, and I fear for his life.
<P>
I would appeal for support for the release of Dawit Isaak.
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="088" NAME="President">
- Mrs Svensson, I can confirm that the President will write accordingly.
