<SPEAKER ID="173" NAME="Carl Schlyter" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
(SV) I would like to point out that, in the Swedish version, paragraph 7, seventh indent, paragraph 8 and paragraph 21 contain several translation errors that mean that the Swedish version does not agree with the other versions in terms of policy and content. I am voting according to the English version and I hope that the translation into Swedish will be correct when this is made public.
