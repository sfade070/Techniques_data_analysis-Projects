- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="095" NAME="BogusÅ‚aw Liberadzki">
rapporteur. - (PL) Mr President, we are discussing Directive 95. I had the honour of reporting on its amendment to the House in September of last year. It is basically concerned with checking functions, as this Directive contains a large number of technical details relating to vehicles, loads and roads. In 1996 a new comitology procedure was introduced, i.e. a regulatory procedure combined with checking.
<P>
Our committee would like to put forward that the new regulatory procedure, combined with checking, should be introduced as part of the framework of the European Commission's competencies as a condition of implementing the updated Directive 95. The dignity of the European Parliament will not suffer as a result. We shall avoid excessive detail in our control function. The committee adopted this draft regulation unanimously. I would ask the House also to speak with a unanimous voice.
<P>
