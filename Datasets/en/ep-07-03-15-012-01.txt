- Before the vote on recitals B and C
<SPEAKER ID="252" NAME="Marios Matsakis" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, a couple of small but important wording errors have managed to creep into the resolution. I propose to correct them as follows: in recital B, to replace the word 'authors' with the word 'perpetrators', and in recital C, to replace the words 'intellectual authors' with the word 'instigators'.
<SPEAKER ID="253" NAME="President">
Are there any objections to the inclusion of these oral amendments?
<P>
(The oral amendments were accepted)
