I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Brok, and also our negotiators: Mr Brok, Mr Verhofstadt and Mr Gualtieri. This was a major piece of work, and many European Parliament committees also contributed. We have achieved a broad consensus. I would like to thank everyone. I would also like to point out that in the near future we will have the two important reports being drafted by Mrs Gräßle and Mr Rapkay, so we have to keep working on this.
