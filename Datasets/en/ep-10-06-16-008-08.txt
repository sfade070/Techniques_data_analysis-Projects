Just one thing - we are giving the Council our trust on credit, but this credit is not without conditions. I am sure that cooperation with the Council over the next year will be much better and much more effective than before.
<SPEAKER ID="133" NAME="Jean-Pierre Audy" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(FR) Mr President, we are voting on the resolution on discharge, and Parliament recalls that we voted on discharge during the previous session. Unfortunately, one heading remained in the report. I will read it to you: 'Reasons for postponement of the discharge decision'. I propose that we table an oral amendment to remove this heading as well as the following heading: 'Further actions to be taken and documents to be presented to Parliament'. I think that this error is due to carelessness.
<SPEAKER ID="134" NAME="President">
Thank you. I think that your amendment is correct, and it is one that we would, in any case, have automatically made in order to bring the approval in line with today's date. I therefore agree with your recommendation.
