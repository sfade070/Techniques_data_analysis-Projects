- Before the vote on Amendment 4:
<SPEAKER ID="125" NAME="Elmar Brok" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Mr President, it is with a heavy heart that I move this compromise amendment, but it may be the key to a clear majority. At the end of the amendment, after 'open the corresponding process', should be added the words 'including the possibility of membership'.

(The oral amendment was accepted)
<SPEAKER ID="127" NAME="Elmar Brok" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) The revised Amendment 6 has been withdrawn.
