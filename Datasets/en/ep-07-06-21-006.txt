Welcome
<SPEAKER ID="039" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to inform you that a delegation from the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea is present in the official gallery.
<P>
I warmly welcome the Korean delegation, which is here to take part in the tenth European Parliament-Korea Interparliamentary Meeting. Mr Lee Sang-Deuk is leading the Korean delegation, which is composed of six members of the National Assembly.
<P>
Our dialogue has developed greater depth and regularity in recent years. It has now become entirely political, covering a vast range of subjects from regional and international security to our citizens' everyday concerns, alongside the increasingly active role of the European Union and South Korea in the international community.
<P>
We are delighted to have these fruitful, stable and ever-deepening cooperative relations with the Republic of Korea.
