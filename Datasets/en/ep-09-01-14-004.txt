<CHAPTER ID="004">
Voting time
<SPEAKER ID="097" NAME="President">
The next item is the vote.
<P>
I would like to inform the Chamber that during the vote, at the express request of the association of parliamentary journalists, for each set of results we must also expressly indicate the number of votes for and against and the number of abstentions. We had wished to simplify things for you, but it is not possible.
<P>
(For details of the outcome of the vote: see Minutes)
