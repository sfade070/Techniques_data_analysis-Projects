- After the vote on Amendment 19:
<SPEAKER ID="098" NAME="Roberta Angelilli">
on behalf of the UEN Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I wanted to speak before the vote. I am speaking under Rule 150 of the Rules of Procedure. Given that our Amendment 19 is the same as Amendment 1 from the PPE-DE Group, the UEN Group withdraws its amendment and would like to co-sign Amendment 1 of the European People's Party and European Democrats.
