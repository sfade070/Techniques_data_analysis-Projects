<CHAPTER ID="005-06">
6. The exclusion of health services from the Services Directive (vote) 
<P>
- Report: Vergnaud
<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="450" NAME="Bernadette Vergnaud " AFFILIATION="PSE">
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I am taking the floor simply to point out to the House that there has been an error.
<P>
Indeed, as the same sentence appears in three different paragraphs, Parliament's services have rightly deleted paragraphs 47 and 53 from the report, since this sentence appears in its entirety in paragraph 51.
<P>
I simply wished to inform my fellow Members of this matter.
