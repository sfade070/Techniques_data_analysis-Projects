Madam President, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon we are talking real money. The amounts that have been dedicated by the European Union to these bailouts dwarf the domestic spending of our national governments. The United Kingdom alone has so far made available GBP 7 billion in Ireland and it is now about to be asked for another GBP 4.2 billion in Portugal.
<P>
GBP 7 billion is more than the value of all the domestic cuts we have made in social security put together - and all for a policy which is now visibly failing. When the Greek bailout was originally agreed we were told that it would be enough to deter the speculators, that Greece would now be borrowing competitively in the market and that no more would be needed. Yet, we now see Greece openly negotiating for a default and for further loans.
<P>
It is clear that we are not going to see the money again. It is also clear that we are breaking the law. These bailouts are not merely unauthorised under the Treaties, they are expressly prohibited and, worst of all, they are damaging to the recipient countries. There is a racket - a Ponzi scheme - whereby governments and banks connive to give money to European bankers and bondholders, while expecting the repayment to come from ordinary European taxpayers. Ireland and Greece are now having to borrow more money to send to Portugal, while at the same time Ireland and Portugal are having to borrow more money to send to Greece.
<P>
Let me finish by quoting my countryman Rudyard Kipling.
<P>
'You will find it better policy to say:--
<P>
'We never pay any-one Dane-geld,
<P>
No matter how trifling the cost;
<P>
For the end of that game is oppression and shame,
<P>
And the nation that plays it is lost!'
<SPEAKER ID="157" NAME="Ashley Fox" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Madam President, we have voted today on the 2009 accounts at a time when governments across Europe are having to take austerity measures: expenditure is being cut and taxes are being increased. Yet, in the European Union, every year the Commission demands more money, and every year the Court of Auditors replies that the money is not being well spent.
<P>
The Court of Auditors says that the 2009 accounts, on which we have just voted, are materially affected by error and that is why I am very pleased that the British Conservatives and our good friends in the European Conservatives have voted against discharge of these accounts. The EU should take much better care of taxpayers' money.
<SPEAKER ID="158" NAME="Syed Kamall" AFFILIATION="ECR">
Madam President, when my constituents ask me about the EU budget, one of the things they do not understand, particularly at the difficult time that we are going through, is why we are spending all this money. At a time when our government is having to make cuts and reduce the level of public spending, and governments across the EU are having to do exactly the same thing, why is it, first of all, that the EU is asking for more money for its budgets and its financial perspective, and secondly that it cannot spend the money it has efficiently?
<P>
As my colleague Mr Fox said earlier, the EU accounts for 2009 were riddled with error. The accounts have not been signed off for 15 years, and all the time our constituents have been asking us why we are not spending their money better. It is time we put our house in order. Whatever you feel about the European Union, it is surely right that we should spend taxpayers' money wisely.
<SPEAKER ID="160" NAME="Bruno Gollnisch" AFFILIATION="NI">
(FR) Madam President, I voted against granting discharge in respect of the implementation of Parliament's budget, not so much for financial reasons as for political reasons, since this House is anything but a Parliament. No talking goes on in it, there is no opportunity to debate in it, even when the fundamental rights of one of its Members are at stake.
<P>
Over and above myself, I feel ashamed for our institution. It is mired in political correctness. There is no confrontation of ideas. There is no real freedom of expression. It is all about conformism. We spend our time doing work that would be far better done by a technical agency responsible for harmonising standards or rules and, other than that, we play at being the United Nations. You defend human rights in Guatemala and Indonesia - anywhere in the world where you have no jurisdiction. You are incapable of defending the rights of one of your Members. I feel ashamed for this Parliament; it is a useless Parliament and a Parliament of useless people.
<SPEAKER ID="161" NAME="Hannu Takkula" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(FI) Madam President, I would like to say a few words about the EU budget. First of all, I think that it is very important to ensure that the way in which the European Parliament spends its money is transparent and open. We are actually going through a time in Europe when all the Member States are having to make budget cuts and watch every penny, so we must also apply the same policy. It is very important that openness and transparency have an important role in all that we do.
<P>
There are, however, a few small areas - of seemingly little consequence - where some wanted to make cuts. In my view, these types of cultural services and cultural awards, such as the LUX Prize, which would represent savings of a few tens of thousands of euros, are not the right areas in which to make savings, because we can see that culture and creative industry have recently been a source of growth. In this respect, it is important that, when we make cuts, we take the view that we should not do so in areas that are sources of growth in the European Union, but instead cut the red tape that does not produce growth.
<P>
Finally, I hope that the pay reforms that apply to us Members of Parliament, and which have gone through, will be implemented everywhere, in each Member State of the European Union at the same time. That is because I understood that this reform was based on the notion that all Members of the European Parliament would receive the same salary, and this should also be taken into account by the nation states in their taxation practices.
<SPEAKER ID="163" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DA) Madam President, we were not able to vote on the final resolution on Pakistan in this House today, but I would very much like to point out that I think it is absolutely reasonable and timely for us to help Pakistan through the very difficult situation that the country is facing. The EU has provided EUR 415 million in emergency aid to Pakistan, and that is a good thing. It is also positive that we are now taking the initiative to remove duties on some important export products in these areas, namely textiles and leather. We are doing this because our experience essentially shows that free trade is a good thing. However, I must say that, at the same time, I find it regrettable and somewhat hypocritical that we are also making indeterminate promises and saying that, if the initiatives that we are taking in respect of Pakistan start to work, we will discontinue them. We will erect the customs barriers again. I think Parliament should revise its view of how this matter should be dealt with. Therefore, it is perhaps very sensible that we have postponed the vote on the resolution.
<SPEAKER ID="164" NAME="Claudio Morganti" AFFILIATION="EFD">
(IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, even though the vote has been postponed, I remain strongly opposed to the report because I do not want to see the death of an industry - textiles - which has been the real driving force and economic backbone of my homeland, Tuscany.
<P>
Today we are allowing duties on textile products from Pakistan to be eliminated: it could then be the turn of India and then who knows which other State. This is the result of the European Union's wretched trade policy. After the floods, Pakistan had already been helped by Europe with almost half a billion euros. It seems that aid is granted partly in order avoid dangerous anti-democratic tendencies. Yet, if I am not mistaken, the most wanted and dangerous terrorist in history was hiding in Pakistan. Did the Pakistani authorities really not know about this? Last year, the Veneto region was also hit by extremely serious floods, which crippled many local textile companies.
<P>
By signing this agreement, we risk all the efforts made to return to production being rendered totally pointless. Textile producers, especially the very smallest, now seem to have been abandoned by Europe, where big manufacturers - which have relocated - rule all. However, we in Lega Nord shall fight until the end to preserve and develop this valuable resource for our territories.
<SPEAKER ID="165" NAME="Paul Murphy" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
Madam President, six months after the floods in Pakistan the UN spoke of a humanitarian crisis of epic proportions. Another three months have passed, and there is still an entirely insufficient response by the EU and the WTO.
<P>
I voted in favour of granting Pakistan emergency trade preferences for textile and other products in the EU in order for these trade preferences not simply to be a purely token measure that filled the pockets of the corrupt elites in Pakistan. I call for effective control over the increased income by democratic trade unions to ensure that the money is directed towards rebuilding schools and hospitals in the areas affected by flooding.
<P>
A major threat to the collective interests of all workers in Pakistan has been brought to my attention by the Progressive Workers Federation of Pakistan. I oppose the disgraceful attempt and threat by the government to no longer allow trade unions to organise on a national level.
<SPEAKER ID="167" NAME="Alfredo Antoniozzi" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Madam President, the Treaty of Lisbon lists foreign direct investment among the matters pertaining to common commercial policy. Indeed, according to Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Union has exclusive competence in this matter.
<P>
Following the entry in force of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have maintained a significant number of agreements with third countries on foreign direct investment. If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter.
<P>
The adoption of measures to substitute the existing agreements is the only way to ensure a high degree of protection for investors and to ensure that their rights are recognised and guaranteed by the legal certainty of such agreements. The draft certainly moves along these lines and I have therefore voted in its favour.
<SPEAKER ID="168" NAME="Antonello Antinoro" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(IT) Madam President, I voted in favour of this report because I am absolutely convinced that we need to control European investments abroad at a time of great crisis and economic uncertainty. In fact, with the entry in force of the new Treaty, responsibility for the protection of investments passes from the Member States to the Union.
<P>
I hope, however, that the Commission will submit a report in September that sets out strategies on this issue. We must regulate the transition phase and it is essential that, through an authorization process, the bilateral investment treaties (BITS) concluded by Member States are respected and that they are allowed, under certain conditions, to renegotiate existing BITS or finalise pending ones and to enter negotiations for further ones.
<P>
Legal certainty remains, however, a relative term as long as the transition of the investment protection regime is not completed and expiry dates are not set for Member States' existing BITs. A transition period is therefore necessary to manage this change and, in order to avoid legal vacuums, the regulation in question leaves the management of the Treaties to the Member States.
<P>
In light of what I have said, I reiterate my hope that the Commission will set out the appropriate strategies in short order.
<SPEAKER ID="170" NAME="Jens Rohde" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DA) Madam President, we have voted today on the provision of EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia. Obviously, these funds will not be provided without imposing the conditions of responsible economic management and transparency. That is clearly important, but it is also important to remember that the provision of this money is in our own interests, as Georgia is very important from a geopolitical point of view. The country was hit by a double blow: first there was the war with Russia in August 2008 and then the global financial crisis. It is still suffering as a result of a trade embargo imposed by Russia. It is therefore in the European Union's interests to support a Western-oriented government that is willing to undertake reforms, which is what we have done with the vote today.
<SPEAKER ID="171" NAME="Adam Bielan" AFFILIATION="ECR">
(PL) Madam President, Georgia is a strategically important country, in particular for the countries situated in the eastern part of the European Union. In addition, it is a participant in the Eastern Partnership programme, which is aimed at strengthening cooperation with EU Member States. The country places a strong emphasis on following pro-Euro-Atlantic policies.
<P>
The recent Russo-Georgian conflict of August 2008 demonstrated how important it is to keep this country within the sphere of European policy. The programme of macro-financial assistance to strengthen Georgia's economy, which has been implemented since 2009, is therefore still crucial for the further development of positive political and economic relations, and also in respect of national security. I therefore agree entirely with the European Commission's proposal regarding the earmarking of additional funds for grants and loans in order to improve Georgia's financial situation.
<P>

in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agreed with the European Parliament's decision to grant the Court of Justice discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009. In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, which included examinations relating to human resources and other administrative expenditure. This assessment had broadly positive results, with the exception of observations concerning a contract concluded for the provision of services. I endorse the suggestion of the Court of Auditors that procurement procedures should be better prepared and coordinated by the Court of Justice. The Court of Justice experienced difficulties as regards recruitment of qualified conference interpreters, and the limitations as well as the need to use a range of interpretation techniques in order to be able to qualitatively and quantitatively satisfy all requests for interpretation. I agree with the rapporteur that the Court of Justice should report on this in its upcoming Annual Reports, given the importance of interpretation for the proper functioning of judicial work.
<SPEAKER ID="173" NAME="Lara Comi" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of authorising discharge of the 2009 budget of the Court of Justice because I believe its formal and substantial accuracy is the result of extremely competent work done by all the staff of this institution.

in writing. - (PT) I welcome the exhaustive analysis carried out in this report by the Court of Auditors, and I call for the continued exchange of best practices between the institutions, as well as effective interinstitutional cooperation regarding development and the implementation of an integrated management system. The report flags up certain situations that still need to be reviewed, and I hope that these are given due consideration. I therefore support and welcome the rapporteur's conclusions.
<SPEAKER ID="173" NAME="Giovanni La Via" LANGUAGE="IT">
Financial control on implementing the European Union budget takes place on three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control, carried out by the EU Court of Auditors; and a discharge procedure carried out by the European Parliament. With today's vote, discharge is granted for the implementation of the budget of the European Court of Justice for the financial year 2009. I voted in favour because controls carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control showed that all transactions were carried out in a wholly legal and regular manner.
<SPEAKER ID="174" NAME="David Martin" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I voted to grant discharge to the Court of Justice, while noting the mixed results in terms of speeding up procedures. I welcome the increase in the number of cases completed by the Court of Justice (377 judgments and 165 orders compared to 333 and 161 respectively in 2008), take note of the number of preliminary ruling cases being the highest ever (302) and welcome the decrease in the number of cases pending at the end of 2009 (741 cases compared to 768 cases at the end of 2008). However, I note with concern that the General Court in 2009 showed a decrease in the number of cases decided and an increase in the duration of the proceedings and that consequently, although the number of new cases in 2009 was lower (568 new cases compared to 629 in 2008), the backlog of pending cases continued to increase (from 1178 in 2008 to 1191 in 2009). I also welcome the fact that the Civil Service Tribunal closed more cases than ever before (155 cases), and that the average duration of a procedure was 15.1 months compared to 17 months in 2008.

With today's resolution, Parliament grants discharge to the Registrar of the Court of Justice for the implementation of the budget of the Court of Justice for the financial year 2009. Parliament notes that, in the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor, which included the examination of an additional sample of transactions involving payments relating to human resources and to other administrative expenditure.

In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the Court of Justice, the Ombudsman and the European Data Protection Supervisor which included the examination of an additional sample of transactions involving payments relating to human resources and to other administrative expenditure. The Court of Auditors found that the Ombudsman has not adopted general provisions on the procedures for the recruitment of temporary staff, although the relevant article of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Union requires that each institution shall have done so. I agree with the rapporteur that this omission may affect a large proportion of the Ombudsman's staff, as the majority of posts granted are temporary. The Ombudsman should report on progress in this area in his annual activity report. The Court of Auditors indicated in its annual report that the audit did not give rise to any further significant observations as regards the Ombudsman.

<SPEAKER ID="177" NAME="Giovanni La Via" LANGUAGE="IT">
I would first like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rivellini, for his excellent work throughout the discharge process. In today's vote, I gave my backing to the request for discharge regarding the implementation of the European Union general budget for the financial year 2009, Section VIII - European Ombudsman. The Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, said that following careful assessment of the budget it had received reasonable assurances as to the reliability of the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 and the legality and regularity of the pertinent transactions. I also applaud the Ombudsman's decision to publish his annual declaration of interests, including on the Ombudsman's own website, and I should like to join the Court of Auditors in praising the quality of the annual activity report submitted by the Ombudsman.

In the course of preparation of the Annual Report concerning the financial year 2009, the Court of Auditors performed an in-depth assessment of supervisory and control systems in the EDPS.

The Court of Auditors found that under certain circumstances the EDPS may run the risk of making incorrect payments to staff.

The Court of Auditors has again drawn the European Parliament's attention to a large volume of carryovers of unspent funds by several agencies in the financial year 2009. I agree with the rapporteur that the agencies concerned should step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming. I also believe that the agencies' expenditure should be predictable and a solution that respects the annuality principle of the Union budget should be found. The agencies should strengthen their internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied. Furthermore, it is important to fully guarantee the independence of agency staff and experts. The Commission should provide Parliament with a detailed overview of the criteria applied in order to ensure the independence of recruited staff. I agree that each agency should establish a multiannual work programme, in accordance with the Union strategy in the sector it deals with. The multiannual work programme is important for enabling an agency to better organise its activities, provide an enhanced risk-assessment of its activities, and make effective organisational arrangements to implement its strategy.

<P>
With reports of this standard, as long as its contents are followed up over the coming years, the quality of EU administration can only increase, invalidating the grounds for complaints from critics of the European Union.
<SPEAKER ID="185" NAME="Diogo Feio" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (PT) In the last few years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of agencies, so the Interinstitutional Working Group on Agencies is crucial, as is the forthcoming special report by the Court of Auditors, with a study on these agencies' performance and a comparative analysis of their costs. It is important to mention the innumerable weaknesses found by the Court of Auditors, and for their extent to be rapidly scaled back.
<P>
I therefore agree with the rapporteur on the need to improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects; to strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level; to correct failings in the recruitment of personnel, and increase its objectivity and transparency; and to implement and comply with the Financial Regulation to which they are subject.
<P>
Finally, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work, and I call on all the agencies to include the conclusions that have been adopted.
<SPEAKER ID="185" NAME="Bruno Gollnisch" LANGUAGE="FR">
Every year, the European Parliament adopts a report on the European agencies to accompany the debates on budgetary discharge. And every year it is the same finding: waste, shortcomings in recruitment and public procurement procedures, carryovers and cancellations of too numerous appropriations ... It is not necessary to uncover fraud, as at the European Economic and Social Committee, to reach a verdict of mismanagement.
<P>
Every time, however, Parliament pretends to see progress, and grants discharge. What is worse, it never calls into question the Commission's policy of outsourcing to these agencies, which appears to be aimed less at effectively implementing the European Union's policies than at providing every major city in the Union with its own small share of European institutions. The nagging question of whether these agencies are effective and useful unfortunately remains unanswered, year after year.
<P>
The few agencies that analyse their performance do so in accordance with the procedures and processes that are imposed on them and not in relation to concrete results. The agencies are useful above all ... to the agencies. That is why we refused to grant discharge to a number of them and abstained on the resolutions that accompanied them.

In addition, it reminds the agencies of the importance of fully guaranteeing the independence of their staff and experts. It argues, overall, for a more constructive and transparent process.

We can say, in general terms, that the results achieved in 2009 are better than the previous results. Nevertheless, it is true that even with respect to the current financial year, the Court of Auditors has noted, in more than one agency, a high level of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations and a high number of transfers. Some agencies have also shown a number of weaknesses in procurement procedures. Certainly, the present context of severe economic crisis must be taken fully into consideration when reviews and assessments are undertaken, but it is also important to highlight the need for a general improvement in the management of subsidies.

in writing. - I voted in favour of the report '2009 discharge: performance, financial management and control of EU agencies' in order to acknowledge that the functioning of all EU agencies needs to be further improved. The discharge procedure for the financial year 2009 revealed that immediate actions are required with regard to transparency and efficiency. For transparency in EU agencies to be improved, all 21 Agencies and the Commission must publish a list of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as a report of the staff members changing jobs from one agency to another, and they must enact stricter rules regarding conflicts of interest as soon as possible.
<P>
Moreover, for the future discharge procedures, the Director of each EU agency should make available to Parliament its report from the Internal Audit Service. To enhance greater efficiency in the functioning and expenditure of the EU agencies, genuine consideration must be given to the possibility of merging Governing Boards for agencies working in related fields. Furthermore, the Commission should deliver an assessment of the feasibility of merging EU agencies with overlapping activities.
<SPEAKER ID="187" NAME="David Martin" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I voted for this Report but am concerned by the Court of Auditors' findings that several agencies had deficiencies in procurement procedures. I call on the agencies to strengthen their internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied. Parliament is not ready to accept the chronic inability to put in place a control system which avoids or detects in time persistent errors undermining the legality and regularity of the agency's transactions.
<P>
I urge, in this respect, the agencies to:
<P>
improve the transparency of estimates and responsibility of projects;
<P>
strengthen their procurement authorisation at the financing decision and work-programme level;

I voted in favour of the report on the 2009 discharge: performance, financial management and control of EU agencies. If we want Parliament to play its role of discharge authority seriously, the MEPs must be given access to more comprehensive and detailed information on the budgetary and financial management of the agencies. We note that the responsibilities are shared, but they also seem to be diluted. Thus, the European Commission, despite being represented within the management boards, reminds us, on the subject of the accounting errors made by the European Police College (CEPOL), that an agency is 'an entity with its own legal personality and has a fully administrative autonomy, which includes financial autonomy.' Yet the management board sometimes delegates sole administrative responsibility to the Executive Director. Finally, the European Parliament decides whether or not to grant discharge to an agency, on the basis of the fairly brief reports by the external auditor, and depends on the goodwill of the Executive Director to be given additional information. I believe it is imperative to fill this gap in the legislation on Internal Audit Service (IAS) reports on the agencies and to propose a solution that will see Parliament granted real powers.
<SPEAKER ID="189" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - I note that the Court of Auditors has once again drawn attention to a large volume of carryovers and cancellations of operational appropriations by several agencies in the financial year 2009. I also note the existence of unused budget lines and the high number of transfers in some of the agencies, and I would call on the agencies concerned to step up their efforts to improve financial and budgetary planning and programming.

in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and agree that the European Parliament should postpone its decision to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009. In its report the Court of Auditors again qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. The College demonstrates a persistent lack of compliance with the Financial Regulation with regard to public procurement rules. A significant amount of the College's total budget contains irregularities. The Court of Auditors identified severe shortcomings in the administrative and financial rules governing expenditure on the organisation of courses and seminars, which accounts for a major proportion of the College's operational expenditure. I agree with the rapporteur that it is unacceptable that the revised College's Financial Regulation has never entered into force and, as a result, all engagement contracts signed were illegal. In the interest of fostering transparency, the College should provide direct access to its budget, which should include a list of its contract and procurement decisions, and should be published on the College's website.
<SPEAKER ID="190" NAME="Lara Comi" LANGUAGE="IT">
I have voted against granting discharge for 2009 for the European Police College, as proposed by the rapporteur, because not even I am convinced by the irregular procedures adopted in the period under review. I consider that more details are required to provide a deeper and more detailed explanation showing the regularity of the accounts.
<SPEAKER ID="190" NAME="Marielle De Sarnez" LANGUAGE="FR">
For the second year in a row, we have been unable to grant discharge to the European Police College (CEPOL) for the financial year 2009. The multiannual action plan that was devised following the identification of the agency's management problems lacks clarity, and the monitoring report fails to give us a proper understanding of the measures put in place. The College admittedly performed better in 2010, following the departure of its former Director, Ulf Göransson, who has been taken to task by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Court of Auditors for his irregular, indeed fraudulent, expenditure. However, it is still unacceptable that this agency, founded in 2006, has yet to meet the criteria of good administration. We must give thought to the very structure of CEPOL, which is clearly too small to function autonomously given the complex rules it must observe as an agency. We must also question why this agency, the role of which is to organise training seminars for national senior police officers, should require its own headquarters rather than be attached to Europol, the Hague-based European Police Office, which everyone praises for its effective services.
<SPEAKER ID="190" NAME="Giovanni La Via" LANGUAGE="IT">
With this vote the European Parliament has decided not to grant discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Police College for the financial year 2009 but to postpone the decision. In effect our decision is based on the considerations of the Court of Auditors, which issued an opinion with reservations on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the budget of the European Police College, by reason of the fact that the procurement procedures did not conform to the provisons of the financial regulation.Therefore I support the request to the College and its Governing Board to inform the discharge authority, by 30 June 2011, of the actions undertaken and improvements made in relation to all the irregular and/or incomplete points raised in the course of this procedure.
<SPEAKER ID="191" NAME="Monica Luisa Macovei" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - The report on the 2009 discharge for the European Police College provided for the postponement of the discharge. I voted in favour of this report in order to acknowledge the structural problems that the College has been facing for many years now.
<P>
For the financial year 2009, almost half of the money carried over to 2009 was not spent, and 43% of the 2009 budget was carried over to 2010. The European Court of Auditors stated that implementation of the College's budget is hampered by severe and recurrent weaknesses in its programming and monitoring. Moreover, serious and repeated violations of public procurement rules were identified: five procurement procedures - worth a total of EUR 455 111 - failed to comply with the rules. Transparency also remains a matter of concern, since irregularities continue to affect staff selection.
<P>
Likewise, I consider unacceptable the lack of investigation of the former Director in relation to his responsibilities concerning College appropriations that have been used to finance private expenditure. Therefore, I advocate the merger of the College into Europol as the best way of achieving greater efficiency in expenditure and tackling the College's structural and chronic problems.
<SPEAKER ID="191" NAME="Véronique Mathieu" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted in favour of postponing the decision to grant discharge for the financial year 2009: the Court of Auditors again qualified its opinion with regard to the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the financial year 2009. In particular, the Court identified severe shortcomings in the enforcement of the financial rules on public procurement and of the rules governing expenditure on the organisation of courses. The report notes that payment appropriations, equivalent to 43% of the total budget, were carried forward to 2010, which is at odds with the principle of annuality. We would like the agency to inform Parliament of the actions taken and the improvements made, and we call on the Court of Auditors to conduct a specific audit on the implementation of the European Police College's action plan. Together with my colleagues, I propose that the College merge with Europol in the Hague. I have my doubts about the College's ability to resolve structural problems linked to its small size, the relocation of its secretariat to Bramshill (70 km from London) and its high governance costs.

The Court of Auditors stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. However, it expressed concern about the lack of coordination between the needs, staff and financial regulation of the Agency and, in particular, that staff selection procedures made it difficult to recruit appropriately qualified personnel. I therefore believe that it is necessary to take the current observations into account.

With today's vote budgetary discharge for 2009 has been granted to the European Aviation Safety Agency. Financial control of the implementation of the Community budget takes place at three levels: internal control, within each institution; external control by the European Court of Auditors; and the discharge procedure of the European Parliament. Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own specific context and today's discharge has taken place at a time of economic and financial crisis, which has created both financial and budgetary problems for some Member States. In spite of such conditions, I wish, nonetheless, to express satisfaction at the results achieved by the Agency and have therefore voted in the manner proposed by the rapporteur.

It notes, in particular, that some of these transfers led to successive increases and decreases in the same budget headings whereas some appropriations were not used and were transferred to other lines during the year.

I voted for discharge of the implementation of the observatory's budget for the financial year 2009. As in previous cases, the Court of Auditors has stated that its actions are legal and regular. It should be taken into account that Parliament granted it discharge in May. Its management seems crucial to me, and I was very pleased to welcome the creation of the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction (REITOX), which enables increased contact between national drug information networks and specialist centres for the sharing of best practices.

The Court of Auditors judged that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. I agree that the Agency should consider making a Gantt diagram part of the programming for each of its operational activities, with a view to indicating in a concise form the amount of time spent by each staff member on a project and encouraging an approach geared towards achieving results. The Agency should set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively. In 2009, the Court of Auditors again noted a high number of budget transfers; therefore the Agency must continue to improve its planning and monitoring in order to reduce the number of budget transfers. The Agency must also take steps to overcome deficiencies in staff selection procedures, which put at risk the transparency of these procedures.

However, the assessment of its activities has been positive.

I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Maritime Safety Authority because, despite the previous absence of a multiannual programme and significant concern over the high number of budget transfers in 2008, the Agency has shown improvements in its management and, taken as a whole, the Court of Auditors had a positive view of the annual accounts and the underlying transactions.

However, it should be stressed that the Court of Auditors has, once again, noted a high number of budget transfers in 2009 (49 in 2009, 52 in 2008 and 32 in 2007), so it is desirable that the EMSA improve its planning and monitoring to thus reduce the number of transfers.

With the vote on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) for 2009, Parliament has been able to confirm the good governance of that Agency and the use of its appropriations for their intended purpose. I welcome this vote, as it reaffirms Parliament's commitment to the Agency, which plays a crucial role in monitoring and supervising Europe's seas. Given that the pressure on our maritime area is growing, we have a duty to be extremely vigilant regarding its use. Hence I am particularly delighted that the proposals contained in my 2008 report on port State control have become key principles underpinning EMSA's work. They relate, for example, to ship inspections and coordination of the various national control systems by the Agency. The sea is an area that belongs to all Europeans, and it is part of our heritage. By promoting the exchange of good practice, relentlessly combating pollution and illegal activities at sea, and preventing accidents, we will be able to benefit from the sea's growth potential for a long time yet.

I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency should strengthen its internal controls to make sure that contracts and procurement procedures are correctly applied. The Agency must also provide regular information on its financial circuits and the responsibilities of the relevant financial and operational actors. Deficiencies in Agency staff selection procedures still remain and put at risk the transparency of these procedures.

I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively. I welcome the Agency's initiative of launching foresight on the safety and health impact of technological innovations in green jobs by 2020. I believe that the Agency must reduce the increased cancellation rate and inform the European Parliament of the actions taken. The Agency must also pay particular attention to the commitments still open at year-end with a view to using unspent funds to cover the subsequent financial and legal obligations.
<SPEAKER ID="272" NAME="Lara Comi" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work because I think that, despite some inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors in the management of some funds and irregularities with respect to a procurement procedure, it can be said that the management on the whole has been good. Furthermore, I support the Court of Auditors' comments regarding the need for improvements in the programming and monitoring of activities with a view to using the available appropriations as efficiently as possible.

in writing. - (PT) I voted in favour of the report on discharge of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions.

This information is essential to enable assessment of health and safety conditions in the workplace in the Union, and of what Europe's current best practices in this field are.
<P>
Despite the Court of Auditors stating that the agency's accounts are reliable, and the fact that the agency effectively coordinated the network of agencies during the process of discharging the budget for the financial year 2009, the rapporteur singled out that it had not provided sufficient information for comparing actions carried out with subsequent years. I deem such information relevant and there should be an accompanying table annexed to the next report by the Court of Auditors, as is suggested.

The Court of Auditors identified an irregularity with respect to a procurement procedure (use of a framework contract beyond its maximum value). The Agency's budget for 2009 was EUR 15 100 000, which is an increase of 0.6% from its budget of 2008. I believe that it is necessary for the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work to address the weaknesses in the procurement procedures.

In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work for the financial year 2009. Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States. Notwithstanding these difficulties, I commend the Agency on the progress it has made, despite a few mistakes, and on its effective work as coordinator of the network of Agencies during the 2009 discharge procedure.

Parliament acknowledges that all 'very important' recommendations issued by the IAS to the Agency were adequately implemented and closed, except the recommendation on validation of accounting systems, which was downgraded to 'important' as a result of its partial implementation; it calls, accordingly, on the accounting officer of the Agency to describe the methodology used in the validation of its accounting system; and it supports the idea of developing cooperation within the existing Inter-Agency Accountants Network in order to come up with common requirements and develop a common methodology for validation of the accounting systems in agencies.

In the absence of an autonomous budget, the Agency is de facto integrated into the Commission.

in writing. - (PT) The European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) works in areas linked to atomic energy, specifically research, and drawing up guidelines for the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy. Through the creation of this agency, Euratom aimed to ensure a regular and equitable supply of ores, raw materials and special combustible materials in the European Union. Despite recent concerns deriving from the accident at the Fukushima plant, nuclear energy forms part of the European 'energy mix'. The supply of whatever materials enable the agency's objectives to be achieved is therefore essential if Euratom is to remain active.
<P>
The rapporteur has confirmed that the agency is, in fact, part of Euratom and has no budget of its own, which is cause for reflection about the usefulness of it remaining organised as it is. I do not have enough information to adopt a position, but I think that the solution that costs the EU least, and offers the greatest efficiency and transparency, should be chosen.

The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Foundation's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. I welcome the Foundation's intention to set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year. This will enable the European Parliament to assess more effectively its performance from one year to the next. I believe that the ex-post assessment exercise of the Foundation's 2005-2008 work programme is extremely useful for the Foundation. This exercise gives the Foundation helpful lessons and recommendations with regard to the challenges facing its future programming phase. I agree with the rapporteur that the Foundation must further develop its Eurofound Performance Monitoring System to ensure that the results of its performance monitoring are fed back into management decision-making and planning. I also believe that the Foundation must take steps to improve its evaluation and review procedure in the area of procurement to avoid future repetition of the assessment errors and inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors.

It is regrettable that the Court of Auditors was compelled to comment on the budgetary and financial statement of the Foundation, especially to the effect that the initial provisional accounts presented by the Foundation contained serious shortcomings, pointing to significant weaknesses in the financial organisation of the Foundation.

I welcome the Agency's initiative to include Key Performance Indicators in its 2010 unit plans. I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must inform the European Parliament on these key indicators and their links to Eurojust's objectives, budget and work programme. Linking indicators to the objectives, budget and work programme of the Agency will allow stakeholders to evaluate Eurojust's performance better.

In June 2009, the Management Board of the Agency adopted a multiannual plan for the period 2010-2013, which will enable the Agency to plan its activities and risk-assess them more effectively.

Due to increased immigration flows, Frontex is required to play an active role in guarding the European borders. According to Frontex, 95% of illegal immigrants entering Europe enter via Greece. Deporting an illegal immigrant costs EUR 6 500 and, under Dublin II, the country of entry is responsible for their deportation. The Member States on the external borders of the EU are all under pressure from immigration and have turned into 'immigration camps' for Europe. We need to support Frontex both financially and operationally and make the external borders of the EU more secure. We also need a mechanism for allocating the overall number of immigrants between all Member States.
<SPEAKER ID="298" NAME="Dominique Vlasto" LANGUAGE="FR">
The vote on this budget discharge definitively approves the increase in the expenditure of the European agency Frontex on its task of controlling our external borders. That significant increase in the budget between 2006 and 2009 was both necessary and legitimate. It corresponds to a need to strengthen coordination of the Member States in the fight against illegal immigration. As the symbol of EU migration policy, Frontex must ensure that its budget is spent on concrete measures to control migration flows. I welcome, in this connection, the launch of a performance management system to give the agency's operations greater visibility. The outcome-oriented system helps to compare operations over time and hence to evaluate them. This 'yes' vote is also, in my view, a strong political message from the European Parliament in favour of the European immigration policy developed under the French Presidency of the Union. A sovereign responsibility that previously fell to the Member States, border security is now handled at European level. This shared management of borders is an essential safeguard allowing for the full exercise of one of the EU's fundamental freedoms: the free movement of persons within the Schengen area.

Temporarily based in Brussels, the regulation provides for it undertaking, inter alia, the following duties, which are currently being revised: management of the contract with the operator charged with running the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), inherited from the Galileo joint venture; coordination of action by Member States on the frequencies necessary for the system to operate; cooperation with the Commission on drawing up proposals in relation to the programme; modernisation of the system; management of all aspects in relation to the system's protection and safety; activities as European authority for GNSS safety approval; and management of the research activities necessary for developing and promoting European GNSS programmes.

It comes as no surprise that the research activities pre-financed in 2008 were not fully implemented during 2009 and that only 65% of the pre-financing was used.

In such cases, a vote is taken on defending an MEP's immunity during a part-session (naturally when he or she belongs to a large political group), which leads me to think that double standards are occasionally applied in the European Parliament, thereby sweeping away confidence in the entire institution.
<SPEAKER ID="326" NAME="Anne Delvaux" LANGUAGE="FR">
You know how committed I am to democratic values ... Bruno Gollnisch, MEP and intellectual guru of the Front National, has requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in connection with measures applied by the French authorities as part of a criminal investigation involving Mr Gollnisch in his role as President of the Front National in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council and in which the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism brought a claim for compensation in January 2009 for incitement to racial hatred.
<P>
Article 8 of the chapter on law and procedure on the immunity of Members of the European Parliament stipulates that the latter shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties. Article 26(2) of the Constitution of the French Republic stipulates the same thing.
<P>
At a time when the Front National is riding high in the French polls and when one may question that party's move into the mainstream (in both media and political terms), I am satisfied that the European Parliament will not defend Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity and have called for it to be lifted so that the courts can do their job.
<SPEAKER ID="326" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report is on the request for the defence of the privileges and immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch. The request was made when the French police attempted to arrest him, in order to appear before the French judicial authorities in a case concerning the expression of political opinions. The case concerns an accusation of incitement to racial hatred made by the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) following the publication of a press release on the site of the Front National Group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, of which Mr Gollnisch was president. Taking into account established practice in this Parliament and the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree with the rapporteur's position and am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch.
<SPEAKER ID="326" NAME="Juozas Imbrasas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) I endorsed this report, because Article 8 of the Protocol on the Privileges and Immunities of the European Union was not invoked by Bruno Gollnisch in his request for defence of immunity and it is not applicable in this case. In order to decide whether or not to defend parliamentary immunity, Parliament applies its own consistent principles. The Committee responsible has found no evidence of a sufficiently serious and precise suspicion that the case has been brought with the intention of causing political damage to the Member.
<P>
Secondly, the case does not come within the scope of Bruno Gollnisch's political activities as member of the European Parliament. It concerns instead activities of a purely regional and local nature of Bruno Gollnisch as regional councillor for Rhône-Alpes, a mandate which is distinct from that of a Member of the European Parliament. Thirdly, Bruno Gollnisch has given an explanation of the publication of the incriminated press release by his political group in the Rhône-Alpes Regional Council, stating that it had been written by the Front National team in that region, including its head of communications. The application of parliamentary immunity to such a situation is considered to constitute an undue extension of those rules, which are intended to avoid any interference with the functioning and independence of Parliament. Finally, it is not for Parliament but for the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be. Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.

Stigmatisation and incitement to hatred on the grounds of religious affiliations are considered offences in France and this situation is equivalent to flagrante delicto. Mr Gollnisch publicly took a stand in support of an outrageous press release. This press release equates Muslims with thugs. It talks about 'invasion and destruction of our cultural values by Islam'. Mr Gollnisch will be able to present his defence. Waiving his immunity allows this to happen. I am therefore voting against his request to protect his parliamentary immunity.

Mr Gollnisch has requested that the European Parliament defend his parliamentary immunity in connection with measures which he claims restrict his freedom applied by the French authorities as part of the judicial investigation of an action and claim for compensation (plainte avec constitution de partie civile) brought by the International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism on 26 January 2009 against an unnamed person for incitement to racial hatred. It was concluded that the case does not fall within the scope of Mr Gollnisch's political activities as Member of the European Parliament, concerning instead activities of a purely regional and local nature as a Rhône-Alpes regional councillor, a mandate to which Mr Gollnisch was elected by direct universal suffrage and which is distinct from that of Member of the European Parliament. There is no evidence in the investigation carried out of fumus persecutionis: in other words, the intention of causing political damage to the Member. I voted for this report, which decides not to defend Mr Gollnisch's privileges and immunity, leaving it to the competent judicial authorities to decide, whilst respecting all democratic guarantees, to what extent French law on incitement to racial hatred has been broken and what the judicial consequences might be.

No debate was allowed before these most important votes (dealing with the fundamental rights of an MEP) were taken. 3. The proposal to lift Bruno Gollnisch's immunity (and the eventual decision to lift it) were inconsistent with the proposal to allow the German MEP Elmar Brok to retain his immunity from prosecution for an (alleged) greed offence of tax evasion. It is clear that the prosecution is a vexatious one, by a private organisation, designed to deprive Mr. Gollnisch of his elected position and his good name.

It is, moreover, outrageous and not in keeping with the nature that members of parliament should lose their immunity and be taken to court for expressing their opinions.

Taking into account established practice in this Parliament, given that the application for parliamentary immunity is misused in this case, and in the light of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree with the rapporteur's position and am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch.

The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3.

It is noted that by adopting a decision to waive the Member's immunity, the European Parliament is allowing the competent national authority to hold the person accountable (given that there is no interference with the functioning and independence of the institution) and by no means does this decision confirm the Member's guilt or express an opinion as to whether certain actions or views justify investigation. Having considered all the arguments, the Committee on Legal Affairs recommends that the European Parliament should waive the parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.
<SPEAKER ID="326" NAME="Jean-Marie Le Pen" LANGUAGE="FR">
My long spell as a parliamentarian both in the French National Assembly and in the European Parliament (27 years) enables me to say that the attitude of the latter in lifting Mr Gollnisch's parliamentary immunity was particularly abhorrent. The MEP was not allowed to take the floor to defend himself before his fellow Members, who incidentally did not take the trouble to read up on the facts of the case. Had they done so, they would have learnt that Mr Gollnisch was only indirectly responsible in this affair and that it related to his freedom of political expression. To give lessons on democracy and respect for human rights is one thing; to respect them in one's own institution is quite another.
<SPEAKER ID="326" NAME="Marine Le Pen" LANGUAGE="FR">
Using a judicial procedure to try to prevent Members of Parliament from expressing their point of view on matters of legitimate public interest and concern and from criticising their political opponents is unacceptable in a democratic society and constitutes a breach of Article 8 of the Protocol on Privileges and Immunities of the European Union, which aims to protect its members' freedom of expression. I wholly support this concept. However, as far as Mr Rapkay is concerned it only applies to Mr De Magistris, who is being prosecuted for libel, and not to Bruno Gollnisch, who is being prosecuted for expressing political opinions. This is a case of double standards. How is it more in the public interest and more democratic for us to know what Mr De Magistris thinks of a fellow Member than for us to know what the Front National thinks about the riots in Romans or the dangers of mass immigration? It is precisely because the opponents of Bruno Gollnisch did not like the press release in question, even though it is of greater public interest, that he is losing his immunity. Freedom of expression for this Parliament's elected representatives should not be a movable goalpost and should not depend on whether or not a person's face fits. It is unworthy of you to adopt this report.

I voted against the waiver of Bruno Gollnisch's immunity because the explanatory statement given by the Committee on Legal Affairs, which recommended the waiver to plenary, was entirely arbitrary. If Mr Gollnisch is charged over a press release written by the political office of the Front National, then of course this activity should be seen as falling within the scope of his EU mandate. The argument that this took place as part of his activities as a regional councillor is not decisive because the EU mandate cannot be seen as a part-time occupation or similar. Had Mr Gollnisch made the same statement in a part-session of the European Parliament or in one of his committees, would the same argument be being made? The content of the press release serving as a basis for extradition is moreover 100% covered by freedom of expression. If politically unpopular statements are now to form a basis for extraditions then it shows once again what the European Parliament thinks of real democracy.

The waiver of Mr Gollnisch's immunity relates to an alleged offence of incitement to racial hatred as a result of a press release issued on 3 October 2008 by the Rhône-Alpes Region Front National Group, of which Mr Gollnisch was president, so these activities were of a purely regional and local nature as a Rhône-Alpes regional councillor, a mandate to which Mr Gollnisch was elected by direct universal suffrage and which is distinct from that of Member of the European Parliament.

in writing. - (PT) I am voting for Mrs Fraga Estévez's recommendation welcoming the European Commission's efforts toward the approval of the resolutions based on the Port State Measures Agreement by the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). In the course of the plenary session of the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) held in March 2010 in Busan. South Korea, a port state measures resolution tabled by the EU was adopted (resolution 2010/11). Similar proposals were also tabled by the EU in other RFMOs, with a view to strengthening the port state measures they currently have in force and bringing them in line with the requirements of the agreement. Unfortunately, they could not be adopted in several cases owing to the opposition of a number of countries, such as some Latin American and small Pacific island countries.
<P>
As advocated by the rapporteur, I too urge the European Commission to continue applying pressure to approve these proposals, as the measures provided for in the agreement will only be truly effective at combating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing if and when they are applied in a comprehensive, uniform and transparent manner, in order to avoid loopholes that could be easily exploited by the IUU fishing operators.
<SPEAKER ID="346" NAME="Antonello Antinoro" LANGUAGE="IT">
I supported the recommendation because the European Union must send out a strong message against illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing. The European Union is a major international player on issues regarding the management of fishing. As such it must lend its support to anything relating to the enforcement of international rules on infringements. Mrs Fraga Estévez has welcomed the efforts made by the European Commission for the adoption of resolutions based on the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Port State Measures Agreement. In committee, we strongly supported the idea of continuing to push for these proposals. Indeed, illegal fishing includes declared ships that fish for undersized species as well as fishing by unauthorised boats in protected areas or too close to coastlines.
<P>
Unfortunately, illegal fishing accounts for some 60% of the products that arrive on our markets, and this causes uncertainties about their quality and makes them difficult to trace. This is why we believe that Europe should set an example to all other countries operating in this sector, which end up gaining an advantage on international markets because they do not have to respect any of the limits imposed on our fishermen.

The shortage of fish stocks at global level and not, therefore, only in our own seas, is gradually becoming an urgent problem. We know that marine life is essential not only for a substantial part of the human diet, but also for the health of the entire ecosystem. It is therefore important that all levels of government - from the regions and central governments right up to the European Union - should do everything in their power to bring in regulatory measures and legislative instruments that will help protect fish stocks, which is the only guarantee of the long-term sustainability of fishing activities.

I voted in favour of this parliamentary recommendation to the Council so that the Council may proceed, on behalf of the EU, to adopt the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. If implemented correctly by national bodies, this international agreement will be an important tool for ensuring the long-term protection of marine life and the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks.

I voted for this report, because with it the European Parliament consented to the approval of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation Agreement, which would promote responsible exploitation of fishery resources and marine eco-systems. This agreement provides for specific instruments to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in EU territorial waters more effectively. These instruments provide for minimum standards which should underpin the adoption of measures by States in order to monitor, control and inspect foreign-flagged fishing vessels wishing to use their harbours. The instruments in this agreement could be applied not only to fishing vessels, but also vessels used for fishing related activities, such as transport vessels which may be used to carry fisheries products. The fight against IUU fishing constitutes an essential component of the common fisheries policy and the EU should be able to foster international cooperation on this matter by participating actively and constructively in the adoption of an international instrument on port state measures.
<SPEAKER ID="348" NAME="Sebastian Valentin Bodu" LANGUAGE="RO">
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is considered as one of the main threats to the resources of the fishing market where the European Union enjoys an important global position. In this case, devising a common EU-level fisheries policy, aimed at protecting the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources is an absolutely natural concern. The agreement being proposed to the Council for adoption has been drafted precisely to meet these international requirements on preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through the implementation of effective measures by the state where the port is located. These are measures which, once the Agreement has been adopted, should go from being a voluntary model to a package of mandatory minimum standards for port states, with the aim of monitoring, controlling and inspecting foreign-flagged fishing vessels using their harbours.
<P>
The fact that the set of measures whose implementation comes under the remit of the port states are produced, all the same, by an international instrument is a bonus. The global overview of this practice of IUU fishing can result in better monitoring of fishing activities overall. It is more cost-effective in terms of organisation and implementation.

Indeed, I believe that the European Union should use every instrument at its disposal to prevent and combat illegal trade while at the same time preserving the fishing market, which has always been a robust pillar of the common fisheries policy.
<P>
It is therefore high time for stringent rules to be adopted and, above all, respected. Ships that do not observe European and international rules on fishing should be banned and greater information on all ships that request access to ports should be guaranteed. Let us not forget that Europe - which is ranked third among the world's fishing powers - has been working for years to ensure that Member States and third countries respect the rules, in order to guarantee a sustainable fishing market and protect the marine environment from possible damage.

It is therefore necessary to step up monitoring, in order to prevent the destruction of aquatic ecosystems, and a subsequent ecological disaster. A rational fisheries policy is particularly important in view of the food crisis, which is a threat we are facing at the same time as the human population is growing.

It is worth reminding ourselves that illegal fishing is still one of the greatest threats to sustainable exploitation of marine biological resources and is as great a threat as intensive fishing. To combat this type of fishing, which depletes marine biological resources and ecosystems, is a vital goal for the European Union. Commissioner Damanaki's recent announcement of a new fishing control system, which will mean fish can be traced from their place of capture to the dinner table, is encouraging. The introduction of a new points system (building up to suspension of a licence) on 1 January 2012 is particularly important. This system aims to ensure that serious infringements are dealt with in the same way, with deterrent fines of a minimum of five times the market value of the illegally caught fish. This system of traceability, combined with control and sanction powers for inspectors deployed throughout European territory, is a vital tool for curbing illegal fishing.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing poses a major threat to the sustainability of fishing in Lithuania. Fish stocks are wasted, the marine environment is destroyed and honest fishermen find themselves in an uncomfortable position. In the Baltic Sea alone, 3800 jobs are under threat because of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. According to the Pew Environment Group, unreported fishing costs Lithuanian fishermen more than EUR 1.1 million every year. This is a huge sum of money given the size of my country and the fact that these problems can be avoided. Unregulated fishing is particularly destructive for cod fishing in the Baltic Sea, which is already in a poor state. Cod is the most valuable fish in the Baltic Sea and the majority of Lithuanian fishermen are dependent on cod stocks. However, our cod fishermen are faced with illegal, unreported and unregulated catches of 40% above official landings. If illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing came to an end, cod fishing in the Baltic Sea could recover.

Millions of Europeans use the right to trade in the EU Internal Market, and to live, work and travel throughout the EU. The EU has legislation that allows cross-border claims and the mutual recognition of national courts' judgments. However, obtaining a legal judgment is only part of the process: citizens and companies must have the right to ensure that these judgments are effectively enforced. A necessary component of effective enforcement is that the courts may, as an interim measure, act swiftly to order disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets. Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors can evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market. The citizen or small business will have spent both money and time in securing a court judgment, only to have to go before another Member State's courts with no guarantee of success or justice. This report threfore indicates the need for an effective regime for freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets, as such I am voting for it.

The Internal Market is without doubt the most important instrument that the European Union has to foster growth in the wake in the recent financial crisis.

This report is important in terms of extending the Single Market to the area of cross-border pre-financing. At the moment, this activity is partially blocked due to the reluctance of creditors in one Member State to grant loans to debtors living in another Member State. One specific example is where a resident of one Member State wants to take out a mortgage with a bank located in another Member State. At present, this transaction is not possible, which means that consumers do not actually have the right to purchase products (banking, in this case) from any EU Member State. The reason for a bank refusing to give mortgages to anyone other than residents of the same Member State (even when the relevant bank is a multinational and is represented in a number of Member States by subsidiaries or branches) is that, in the event of a default on the loan, the bank is obliged to proceed with a forced execution procedure in accordance with lex rei sitae (the law of the state where the property for which the mortgage has been arranged by the lending bank is located) and not with the law of the state where the creditor has its registered office.

The burden of proof should also rest with the applicant, who should submit proper evidence of the legal plausibility (fumus boni juris) and urgency (periculum in mora) of a case. These criteria should be assessed by national courts on the basis of the existing case-law of the European Court of Justice. The effect of an EOPA must apply only to the freezing of bank accounts and the temporary freezing of bank deposits, and it should not grant creditors any form of ownership rights to the assets of the debtor.

I fully support the notion in this report of asking the Commission to propose more effective instruments for implementing the legislation, to supplement those which already exist for dealing with cross-border claims, such as the Brussels I Regulation or the Small Claims Procedure. Courts should have the necessary instruments available to act swiftly and freeze the assets of the debtor or alleged debtor, however not under any circumstances. We must strike a balance between protecting creditors and protecting the rights of debtors to avoid any arbitrary situation.

The possibility of obtaining an EOPA without any notification and prior hearing for the relevant party is an infringement on the debtor's rights and is contrary to current case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Late payments and unpaid debts harm businesses and consumers alike. Even when the courts have delivered a judgment, in practice it is often difficult for creditors to recover debts if no information is available on the whereabouts of the debtor and his assets. It is even more difficult when the debtor is domiciled in another Member State. At present the number of cross-border debts successfully recovered is particularly low, and the cost of cross-border debt recovery can be prohibitive and can deter parties from engaging in legal proceedings. The time has come to simplify and speed up the recovery procedure.

At the time of the adoption of the Stockholm Programme, the Commission was asked to table specific proposals aimed at a simple and autonomous European system for the seizure of bank accounts and the temporary freezing of bank deposits.

As such, and following Parliament's adoption of various resolutions reinforcing this idea, in this own-initiative report, the rapporteur asks the Commission to introduce two instruments - a European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and a European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) - to be implemented in national law and to concern only cross-border cases. These instruments aim to ensure the rapid implementation of measures by the courts, enabling the freezing of debtors' assets and preventing the relocation or transfer of their assets.

There is a need for this measure, to guarantee the rights of individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Naturally, this does not bring an end to our opposition to and reservations about fundamental aspects of the Single Market, its nature, objectives and impact.

This is particularly true in view of legislative developments in recent years, when measures such as the European Enforcement Order, the Small Claims Procedure and the European Payment Order were incorporated into Union law, because these measures cannot be fully realised without the implementation of the European Order for the Preservation of Assets and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets.
<P>
Although I support the Commission's call to submit a proposal for legislative amendments to both measures, this does not mean automatic support for the Commission proposal. In assessing this proposal I will place emphasis above all on its specific form, stressing its use exclusively in transboundary cases, the jurisdiction for the exercise of these measures and also the restriction on the exercise of these measures only to cases where it is absolutely necessary.

In the current context of the European Internal Market, it is increasingly important to defend the rights of consumers, in particular those who are less well-off. European legislation allows for cross-border claims, as well as the mutual recognition of the decisions of national courts, but the current procedure for cross-border debt recovery is arduous and prohibitively expensive. The purpose of the report with recommendations on proposed interim measures for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border cases is for European citizens and businesses to have the right for these decisions to actually be enforced. The lack of this type of measure sends a signal of impunity to recalcitrant debtors and makes it easier for rogue traders to evade their responsibilities, as they can simply move their assets to another jurisdiction to prevent a court judgment from actually being enforced. This forces citizens to go before another Member State's courts, with no guarantee that this costly process will have a favourable outcome. I have therefore been unable to vote against this report, which sets out measures aimed at protecting these rights.
<SPEAKER ID="368" NAME="Georgios Papanikolaou" LANGUAGE="EL">
Freedom of trade and the smooth operation of the Internal Market in the EU come with rights and obligations attached. One of the public's basic rights is to suitable means of recourse in the event that they have a claim against an individual or against a company that has caused them a loss.
<P>
In addition, care must be taken to ensure that any court judgments are enforced quickly, so that the individuals or companies responsible and liable for compensation have no margin to evade their responsibility by simply transferring their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying effective enforcement of the judgment on the debtor within the Single Market. This practical, yet important, loophole is identified in the own initiative report, which I voted in favour of.
<SPEAKER ID="368" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
The most important instrument that the EU has to promote growth in the heat of the financial crisis is its Internal Market. At the moment, EU law is not effectively applied, particularly in the area of civil justice. In fact, the current level of payment of cross-border debts is very low, both with regard to the assets of private individuals and of businesses. This fact in itself discourages cross-border trade by sending a message of impunity to debtors, and damages the economic performance of the EU. In fact, the cost of the cross-border settlement of debts is currently prohibitive for creditors in cases where the debtor has assets in different Member States. This prevents the Internal Market from working properly. European Union measures are essential, in order to put an end to this situation and provide EU citizens with effective recourse should they have a claim against another citizen or company; measures that simplify and accelerate this payment process. Therefore, I voted in favour of this report, in which the European Parliament calls on the Commission to table legislative proposals on measures for the freezing and disclosure of the assets of debtors and alleged debtors in cross-border cases.
<SPEAKER ID="368" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
To create a Single Market, parties must be given the necessary mechanisms that allow their debts to be settled throughout the Union. This concept gave rise to the Brussels I Regulation, for example, with the aim of setting up a single system for recognising legal judgments within the EU. However, it continues to be extremely difficult for a creditor to enforce a debt if the debtor's assets are divided between several Member States, which - there is no harm in repeating it - creates serious difficulties for the implementation of a true Single Market. The European Order for the Preservation of Assets (EOPA) and the European Order for the Disclosure of Assets (EODA) may prove to be good instruments for this requirement. Therefore, I voted for this report.
<SPEAKER ID="369" NAME="Evelyn Regner" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (DE) I voted in favour of the report because millions of citizens of the European Internal Market need effective legal means of asserting their claims against other citizens or against enterprises. People who exercise their right to live, work and travel within the EU should not in future be allowed to fall victim to unscrupulous profiteers and other debtors who evade their responsibilities simply by moving their assets to another country. In such cases creditors are often refused enforcement of the judgment in the Internal Market, as a result of which citizens or small enterprises lose money and time because they are referred to courts of other Member States once court proceedings have already been initiated. Moreover, to guarantee effective enforcement the courts must be able to order the disclosure and freezing of the debtor's assets within the context of measures to provide interim legal protection.
<P>
The current legal provisions in the European Union, which allow the reciprocal recognition of national court rulings and cross-border claims, are not sufficient. Citizens and enterprises also need to have the right to have such rulings enforced effectively.

The most important reason for that is that the error percentage remains too high. The report on the European Commission by rapporteur Chatzimarkakis spells out the areas of concern brilliantly. However, the Committee on Budgetary Control has failed to conclude that the grant of discharge should be postponed, despite the fact that that is exactly the tool we should be using to exert pressure on the European Commission and Member States to make improvements. For example, the national declarations of assurance. They help improve shared management, and that also means structural funds.
<P>
The many complicated rules connected with structural funds and research grants present another major difficulty. This is why I have tabled an amendment to the report by Mr Garriga Polledo from the Special Committee on the Policy Challenges and Budgetary Resources for a Sustainable European Union after 2013. With my amendment, I request that the European Commission ensures every proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment. That impact assessment must be carried out independently, not by the European Commission itself. To conclude, reduction of the regulatory burden and national declarations of assurance should lead to fewer errors in financial management. By granting discharge, the European Parliament is throwing away the most important tool it has ever had at its disposal. The Chatzimarkakis report deserved a better fate.

<SPEAKER ID="373" NAME="Marielle De Sarnez" LANGUAGE="FR">
The vote on granting discharge to the Commission for the 2009 financial year has come at a very significant political moment, since the negotiations on the next multiannual financial framework will be marked by a revision of the financial regulation. This was therefore an opportunity for Parliament to give new impetus and vitality to a procedure that is not always taken seriously. Parliament has approved the Commission's budget spending for 2009, having obtained undertakings aimed at giving Member States more responsibility and improving control by national authorities of Union expenditure. More effective management and control systems must be established. In future, national political bodies will be obliged to sign national management declarations making them accountable for the way in which Union funds have been spent in their countries. The financial crisis that is currently shaking Europe also has implications for the EU budget. We cannot tolerate any scandal or mismanagement of expenditure.

We believe that there may be a need for Commission staff to have additional travel days - some can have long distances to travel and may need to change planes or other forms of transport several times. In addition, changes to the EU's Staff Regulations can only be made within the framework of a codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council. Therefore, the discharge process is not the right forum for these issues. The reform of the Staff Regulations will be dealt with at a later date in the European Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs.

I could not support some of the paragraphs from the report, which referred to the forthcoming review of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities. The reasons behind my decision are that revision of the Staff Regulations goes beyond the remit of the Committee on Budgetary Control and does not belong in the 2009 discharge report, but falls instead within the competence of the Legal Affairs Committee, which will be dealing with these issues in the near future. I believe that we have to take an overall approach and make a comprehensive review of the Regulations as a whole, rather than a fragmented one with various reports addressing various regulations.

By adopting this decision the European Parliament grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the European Union for the financial year 2009 and sets out its comments in related documents. I feel that it is necessary to simplify and reduce public procurement rules in order to reduce the overall incidence of errors. Governance problems between the Financial Regulation and the cohesion regulations can be avoided by better alignment of eligibility rules across various policies. Simplification, in particular in connection with the revision of the Financial Regulation, needs to ensure stable rules and management schemes in the long term. I regret that in considering the implementation of the budget for the 2009 financial year, the Court of Auditors has again chosen to focus on energy and research policies rather than on transport policy. There is nevertheless a need for greater transparency through the provision of proper information to taxpayers and budget authorities, and for regional and transport policies to be more closely coordinated, as at present only cursory consideration is given to the potential European added value of projects and, consequently, funds are not used as effectively as possible to eliminate bottlenecks and problems relating to border crossings or inadequate connections.

I do not accept that workers should be forced to work longer as a result of cuts, regardless of who their employer is. Workers' rights should be guaranteed and defended. If their function has become obsolete, they should have access to similar jobs with the same conditions. Elected representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should, at the very least, accept that their own privileges undergo the same treatment.

This is far more than the annual contribution of Slovakia to the EU budget. We are expected to approve the accounts of the 27 European agencies, although I suspect that Europe would be better off without these agencies. What is more, in the draft budget for next year we are going to increase precisely those sectors in which the audit found the greatest discrepancies. Saddest of all is the fact that it makes no difference whether this Parliament gives or does not give its blessing to the management of the European agencies and institutions. Everything will continue as usual. The stricter rules for the redistribution and accounting of these resources will solve nothing, because they will lead to more bureaucracy and slower payments, thereby ultimately undermining the effectiveness of support programmes. I would therefore like to advocate a phasing out of redistribution, which is becoming a less than transparent instrument for the social engineering of today. It distorts the market, reduces competitiveness and deprives people of initiative and responsibility for how and where they live. The less money we redistribute on the basis of political priorities, the less risk of corruption there will be and the more viable will be Europe's regions and our entire economy.

I support this report, especially what it says about the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the reform of the sugar sector. That report drew attention to the significant problems evident in the sugar sector since it was reformed in 2006 and to the problems that former sugar producers now face. Without the report of the Court of Auditors those difficulties would not be reported. The sugar plants played an important role in the agricultural sector, particularly in Ireland, where there were processing plants in Cork and in Carlow, and it could be argued that the reform put an end to the sugar sector in Ireland.
<P>
As stated in the report, insufficient information was provided about the impact on the processing regions, the impact of quota refusals on local economies, the jobs that would be lost and the distribution of compensation. There was a lack of transparency and information associated with the reform process for those working in the sector and for European taxpayers and there must now be clarity and honesty about the impact of the reform throughout the European agricultural sector.

The Court of Auditors found the payments as a whole to be free from material error. It found no material weaknesses when assessing the compliance of supervisory and control systems with the Financial Regulation. The Secretary-General of the European Parliament certified his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations. I agree with the rapporteur that it is necessary for Parliament, along with all Union institutions, to find the most cost effective ways of using financial and staff resources, including possible savings, as well as electronic tools and methods, to provide efficient services. I believe that the Secretary-General of the European Parliament must propose arrangements to ensure that use of the general expenditure allowance is transparent in all cases and that it is used for the purposes intended. I also agree that Parliament should only have one workplace in the same location as the other Union institutions. Currently the decision to change this situation - and to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings annually, as well as to considerably lessen Parliament's carbon footprint - lies exclusively with the European Council. We need to further rationalise the missions between the three working places, justifying and monitoring them better in order to avoid unnecessary missions and costs.

In view of the current economic situation, the European Parliament has a duty to set an example in terms of cutting costs. Among the intended cost-saving measures, it has been decided that an interpretation service will automatically be provided for meetings of working groups in six languages only (French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian), whilst other languages will only be made available if Members request them. Other demands include rules restricting long distance journeys by official Parliament cars. The resolution also calls for a long-term review of Parliament's budget with a view to reducing costs. This vote also provided an opportunity to revive the debate on where the seat of the European Parliament should be. However, this situation is linked to a historical background and to legal statutes that cannot be challenged on the basis of often mistaken attacks concerning the costs or problems associated with the dispersal of the European Parliament's premises. There is no question of choosing between Strasbourg and Brussels in this instance, since according to the Treaties that founded our Union in the beginning, Strasbourg is the rule and Brussels the exception.
<SPEAKER ID="386" NAME="Anne Delvaux" LANGUAGE="FR">
Once again, I voted in favour of this report which points out that real savings could be made if Parliament only had one workplace, in the same city as the European Union's other institutions (in other words Brussels). The report of the Secretary-General on Parliament's preliminary draft estimates for 2011 itself draws attention to the huge annual costs arising from the geographical split of Parliament, estimated at some EUR 160 000 000, which accounts for 9% of Parliament's total budget.
<P>
It is true that at present the decision to change this situation, and in doing so to make some EUR 160 000 000 of savings per year, whilst at the same time considerably lessening Parliament's carbon footprint, lies solely with the Council.

The same concept is already covered by paragraph 199 on which I voted in favour. Paragraph 119 is more comprehensive and more practical for implementation purposes.
<SPEAKER ID="389" NAME="Anna Hedh, Olle Ludvigsson, Marita Ulvskog and Åsa Westlund" LANGUAGE="SV">
We Swedish Social Democrats have chosen to grant discharge to the European Parliament for the financial year 2009.
<P>
We would like to emphasise that, as a public institution, the European Parliament must strive to demonstrate as much openness and transparency as possible. We therefore chose to support paragraph 5, which calls for greater transparency with regard to Members' expenditure allowance.
<P>
We also believe, particularly in view of the current economic situation, that Parliament must review its expenditure and identify savings and ways to increase efficiency. Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues, which is why we would also like to provide more room for the discharge debate. We also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel, even though we find it difficult to see how this could be implemented in practice.
<P>
Finally, we do not believe it is wrong for Parliament to award cultural prizes. However, we are highly critical of Parliament's Prize for Journalism, and do not believe that it is appropriate for Parliament to award prizes to journalists whose task it is to critically examine the European Parliament. We therefore believe that this prize should be abolished.

in writing. - (LT) I abstained from the vote on this document, although the audit of the Court of Auditors states that, as regards administrative expenditure in 2009, all the institutions satisfactorily operated the supervisory and control systems required by the Financial Regulation and the transactions tested were free from material error. The Secretary-General also certified, on 2 July 2010, his reasonable assurance that Parliament's budget has been implemented in accordance with the principles of sound financial management and that the control framework put in place provides the necessary guarantees as to the legality and regularity of the underlying operations. I believe that the current financial situation necessitates that the Parliament, along with all Union institutions, finds the most cost effective ways of using financial and staff resources, including possible savings, as well as electronic tools and methods, to provide efficient services. We need to carry out a long-term review of the European Parliament budget and determine the money that can be saved in the future, in order to reduce costs and find the funds to enable Parliament to operate efficiently as one of the legislative bodies. I would also point out that citizens have the right to know how the money they pay in taxes is spent and how the Union's institutions and political bodies use the powers they are given.

There is no reason not to raise the retirement age for the Scheme from 60 to 63 (paragraph 129(ii)).

in writing. - (RO) I voted for this report as I think that some measures are needed, aimed at both making MEPs' activities more efficient and improving the performance of the institution's officials and infrastructure in terms of security, IT, visitor access and reducing the carbon footprint. The security policy must be reviewed by implementing a smart, state-of-the-art security system for Parliament, using measures inside buildings and access control procedures, as well as in the area of the EU institutions. On the ICT front, improvements are required with regard to wireless network access inside the institution's buildings. On the other hand, the ICT department should propose specific measures for replacing hard copy administrative documents with environmentally-friendly, electronic versions. The EU's institutions are a major tourist attraction in Brussels.
<P>
Surveys show that the influx of tourists is higher during holiday periods and at weekends. The operation of the visitors centre and visit programme ought to be adapted to these demands. Meeting the 30% reduction target in carbon emissions by 2020 is a priority. I support the initiative in favour of replacing the current car fleet with environmentally-friendly vehicles, given the small distances travelled, which is appropriate for the battery life of electric vehicles.
<SPEAKER ID="387" NAME="Paul Murphy" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
in writing. - I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution as the general idea of cost efficiency in the EU is brought up. I am in favour of cutting costs related to the European Parliament. However, savings cannot be made at the expense of ordinary workers working in the European Parliament; their rights should be safeguarded at all times.
<P>
I support spending on the promotion of accessible artistic and cultural events which can enrich the lives of the population; this is why is supported the LUX film prize, despite misgivings on the seemingly large budget spent on this particular award. Savings can, and should, be made by limiting the expenses and wages of MEPs, for instance by linking the daily allowance to vouched-for expenses.
<P>
I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63. I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment. However, I do not agree that the retirement age for workers should be raised. I will continue to support workers and trade unionists in their struggle against the increase in the retirement age.

I voted in favour of Mr Itälä's report, but I have reservations about recital 113. I totally disagree with this recital, which proposes a new system for interpretation services for 'working groups'. I cannot agree with it, because the proposed system: does not square with the principle of equal treatment of the Union's official languages and of their users; will eventually undoubtedly lead to the exclusion of languages other than the six mentioned; will, in practice, be impossible to run in a workable fashion, for the simple reason that the member concerned will have to submit a request for interpretation in a supplementary language before they get to see the agenda; risks turning the language policy into a power game. If we really want to make savings when it comes to languages, then we should demand that this system apply equally to everyone.
<P>
If we cease to attach so much importance to the principle that some members should be allowed to speak in their own language, this will become less important for other members, too. There is, therefore, only one alternative if we have to economise on interpretation services in the 'working groups': use of English, and English only, as the medium of both speaking and listening. In that case, everyone will be equal before the law and we will be able to make savings.
<SPEAKER ID="399" NAME="Derek Vaughan" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - I was unable to support granting discharge to the European Parliament as some concerns remained unresolved. Although Parliament has taken steps to improve its budget and make savings, questions remain over some issues such as funding for prizes, which are currently paid for by the tax payer. In addition to this, the final report failed to acknowledge the amount of money being wasted on Strasbourg. The report did, however, show that some progress is being made. Following today's vote, new rules will need to be put in place to ensure that MEPs from all EU countries take steps to ensure the transparency of their office expenses. The report also called for a review of Parliament's expenditure in order to guarantee savings are made in future.

The Council has not accepted any invitation to officially and formally meet Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, responsible for the discharge procedure, or its rapporteur to discuss matters concerning the Council budget execution for 2009. The Council also refused to provide a written answer providing Parliament with the information and documents it requested. I agree with the rapporteur that the Council must provide Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control with comprehensive written answers, as well as all the required documents, by 15 June 2011 at the latest. The Council must also be accountable to the public for the funds entrusted to it, and in order to facilitate the exchange of information in the discharge procedure, it must follow the same approach as the other institutions.

Therefore, I agree with the rapporteur regarding his decision to postpone the decision on discharge of the Council's accounts until the latter supplies the information and documents requested by the rapporteur and also a complete list of budget carryovers.

in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document, because it postpones its decision on granting the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in respect of the implementation of the Council budget for the financial year 2009. The reasons for the postponement of the discharge decision are as follows: Firstly, the Council has not accepted any invitation to officially and formally meet Parliament's Committee responsible for the discharge procedure or its rapporteur to discuss matters concerning the Council budget execution for 2009. Secondly, the Council refused to provide a written answer providing Parliament with the information and documents requested from the Council in the annex to a letter of 14 December 2010 signed by the rapporteur. Thirdly, Parliament has not received fundamental documents from the Council, such as the full list of budgetary transfers. I voted in favour of this decision, because it is my deep conviction that citizens have the right to know how the money they pay in taxes is spent and how the institutions and political bodies use the powers they are given.
<SPEAKER ID="400" NAME="Agnès Le Brun" LANGUAGE="FR">
As required each year, the European Parliament has delivered its opinion on whether or not the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it. The allocated sums are earmarked for specific purposes, and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to. This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999. This year, together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, I refused to grant the Council of Ministers discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year. The institutions whose activities are audited by Parliament through the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am a member, are obliged to cooperate with that committee, for example by providing it with all the documents that are needed to ascertain that public money is being properly used. However, in this instance the Council's cooperation was completely inadequate. This is why we decided to postpone the discharge until the autumn, so that the checks required for the sake of budgetary transparency can be carried out.

The Council needs to be scrutinised in the same way as every other European institution, and written documents must be provided in order for discharge to be granted. The report put a number of questions to Council, many of which have not been answered. Without concrete explanations from the Council on specific issues, it is not possible to give them the green light for their accounts. The decision to grant discharge will be taken at a later date, when sufficient information has been provided.

In the light of the new situation created by the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon the continuing refusal of the Council to be subjected to a discharge procedure - thereby taking accountability into account - is unacceptable. The Council's expenditure needs to be monitored just as much as that of the other Union bodies if due account is to be taken of the European Transparency Initiative.

in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report and endorsed the European Parliament's decision to grant the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds (EDF) for the financial year 2009. The EDF is the main instrument for providing Union development aid to the people of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the overseas countries and territories. The Court of Auditors judges that the final annual accounts of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth EDFs present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the EDFs as of 31 December 2009. I also agree with the rapporteur that there should be EDF budgetisation, which will strengthen the democratic control, accountability and transparency of funding and will provide more coherence in Union policy concerning ACP countries. I also believe that, within the scope of the revision of the guidelines on budgetary support by the Commission, particular attention must be given to supervisory and control systems. The Commission must strengthen monitoring and annual reporting on compliance.

in writing. - (BG) During a financial crisis, the European Union needs to focus its expenditure on dealing with the crisis. Around 15% of citizens in the European Union live below the poverty threshold. What significance do the Eight, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds have for these people? I am not against the European Development Funds, but I think that, in order to support the other countries, the European Union needs to deal with its own problems first. I am sure that these 15% of European Union citizens expect the same.
<SPEAKER ID="417" NAME="Lara Comi" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted in favour of the authorisation to discharge the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds for 2009. I did so because, on reading the report, I was able to see how effectively the resources have been managed with respect to achieving the established objectives. Moreover, I agree with the development priorities and believe that the accounting procedures are perfectly calibrated for the ex-ante prevention of errors, fraud and hoarding by subjects with no entitlement.
<SPEAKER ID="417" NAME="Diogo Feio" LANGUAGE="PT">
The European Development Funds (EDF) continue to constitute the principal instrument that the EU has for granting development aid to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCTs) and, though implemented according to specific financial rules, remain outside the EU budget. It therefore urgently needs to be integrated with the EU budget to enable increased democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing.
<P>
This report makes an exhaustive analysis of the budgetary situation of the eighth, ninth and tenth EDF, drawing attention to some important questions that urgently require the review and implementation of ex ante controls in the delegations and internal control systems of the partner countries, particularly with regard to public tender procedures.
<P>
Finally, this report shows once more that there is still a long way to go with regard to management of the EDF and their proper use, which is why I agree with all the rapporteur's conclusions and congratulate him on his work.
<SPEAKER ID="417" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Greater consistency is needed in EU development aid and cooperation policy, particularly with regard to the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. This is even more important now, when these countries are faced with enormous pressures - and even blackmail - from the EU to accept impositions in the form of the 'Economic Partnership Agreements' that threaten their interests and compromise the effectiveness of the support provided under instruments such as the European Development Funds (EDF).
<P>
The rapporteur maintains that the incorporation of the EDF into the Union budget will strengthen democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing. We would stress the warning that this incorporation of the EDF into the EU general budget must not lead to an overall reduction in development spending with regard to the two current finance instruments.
<P>
As the rapporteur mentioned it, we would also stress the need to study and assess the best ways to increase destination countries' capacities for absorbing EDF aid, which immediately means the profound involvement of both governments and peoples in outlining and implementing programmes, and in setting priorities. As the rapporteur says, full knowledge of appropriate expenditure is also necessary.

The report refers to the Commission's statement to the effect that it wants to propose to incorporate the EDF into the Union budget during discussions on the next financial framework, and that it will keep Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control fully informed of this initiative. Parliament insists, however, that the incorporation of the EDF into the Union budget must not lead to any overall reduction in development spending with respect to the two current funding instruments. It urges the Council and the Member States to respond positively to the Commission's proposal and to agree that the EDF will be fully incorporated in the Union budget from 2014 onwards, as part of the next financial framework. It believes this measure to be long overdue, and that budgetisation of the EDF should take place at the earliest possible date.

In its report on the accounts of the Agency, the Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying transactions. The Court of Auditors found errors in the procurement procedures corresponding to a significant amount of the Agency's total budget for the financial year 2009. I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must improve the quality of its procurement procedures in order to put an end to the shortcomings identified by the Court of Auditors. The Agency's Internal Audit Service found particularly serious shortcomings in the area of medicine evaluation. I find it unacceptable that the Agency does not apply the relevant rules effectively, meaning that there is no guarantee that the evaluation of human medicines is performed by independent experts. The Agency is not complying effectively with its code of conduct by setting out principles and guidance on independence and confidentiality applicable to the management board and committee members, experts and Agency staff. I agree that the Agency must inform the European Parliament of the steps it has taken since its inception to ensure the independence of its experts.
<SPEAKER ID="422" NAME="Lara Comi" LANGUAGE="IT">
I voted against the authorisation to discharge the 2009 general budget of the European Medicines Agency. I did so because, as reported by the Court of Auditors, there were some irregularities in the transactions on which the accounts are based, which cause concerns about the correct use of funds. I am therefore in favour of postponing the closure of accounts for the financial year 2009 so that further management checks can be carried out.
<SPEAKER ID="422" NAME="Marielle De Sarnez" LANGUAGE="FR">
In the absence of sufficient guarantees as to the independence of the experts recruited to perform scientific assessments on medicines for human use, we have voted to postpone granting the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009. In particular, this issue of independence concerns the assessment of the appetite suppressant benfluorex, the active ingredient in the product Mediator, which may have suffered from conflicts of interest. It appears that this drug may have been responsible for the deaths of an estimated 500-2 000 people and caused severe heart damage in thousands of others. This case reveals a degree of failure of expert assessments and raises the question of the experts' skill and independence in our risk society. We must therefore be seen to be extremely vigilant. This is why we refused to give our blanket approval.

The main reasons are as follows: failure to issue a formal invitation to tender, failure to prepare detailed technical specifications in advance, failure to clearly define in the technical specifications all the products to be purchased before the negotiation started, failure to appoint an evaluation committee and failure to prepare an evaluation report. The shortcomings indicated in the report also need to be remedied, because the Agency is a source of important scientific advice, science-based recommendations, and best practice for medicine evaluation and supervision in the Union.
<SPEAKER ID="423" NAME="Giovanni La Via" LANGUAGE="IT">
With today's vote Parliament has decided to postpone the closure of the accounts of the European Medicines Agency for the financial year 2009. We felt unable to grant discharge because, as a result of the checks and assessments carried out, the Court of Auditors revealed several matters of significant importance. The main concerns regard the management of procurement procedures and criteria used for recruiting staff. I therefore add my voice to the request for information made to the Agency, in which the Agency is also urged to inform the discharge authority, by 30 June 2011, of the measures taken and improvements achieved regarding all these worrying issues.
<SPEAKER ID="423" NAME="Agnès Le Brun" LANGUAGE="FR">
As it is required to do each year, the European Parliament has been asked for a decision on whether the Union budget has been properly implemented by the various agencies and institutions who are responsible for it. The sums are allocated for specific purposes and the aim of the discharge procedure is to check in retrospect that these purposes have been adhered to. This is an important prerogative of Parliament, as illustrated for example by its influence on the resignation of the Santer Commission in 1999. This year, together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, I refused to grant the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year This is because the independence of experts recruited to perform scientific assessments on medicines for human use has not been properly guaranteed. For example, doubts still remain about possible conflicts of interest in relation to the assessment of the appetite suppressant benfluorex. The agency's procurement procedures and criteria for recruiting staff have also attracted criticism. While the Mediator scandal prompts us to reinforce our precautions before allowing medicines to be placed on the market, the serious malfunctioning of the European Medicines Agency must be penalised.
<SPEAKER ID="424" NAME="Monica Luisa Macovei" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - The report on the 2009 discharge for the European Medicines Agency provided for postponement of the discharge. I voted in favour of this report for three main reasons. Firstly, the European Court of Auditors found serious irregularities in several procurement procedures, including in one IT contract worth around EUR 30 million. Because of these errors, best value for money was not ensured. Secondly, the European Medicines Agency breached personnel selection rules, and thirdly it failed to prevent conflicts of interest: a month after retiring from the Agency, the former Executive Director joined a consultancy which, inter alia, advises pharmaceutical companies on developing new medicinal products and reducing the time period to their market introduction. Although the European Medicines Agency Management Board eventually decided to set limits with regard to the former Executive Director's new and future professional activities, the discharge authority needs further explanations from the Agency on how cases of conflict of interest are actually handled.
<SPEAKER ID="424" NAME="Véronique Mathieu" LANGUAGE="FR">
I voted in favour of postponing the decision on discharge for the 2009 financial year, as the Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the 2009 financial year. Among other things, the Court drew attention to carryovers and cancellations of significant budget appropriations: for example 38% of the budget under the title 'Buildings, Equipment and Miscellaneous Operating Expenditure' was carried over to 2010. EUR 14.8 million of this carryover was for activities as yet not implemented (or, in some cases, for goods not received) at the year-end, which is at odds with the budgetary principle of annuality. The Court of Auditors highlighted weaknesses in the management of fees, with significant delays in issuing recovery orders (up to 21 months), as well as weaknesses in the Agency's treasury policy and failings in its management of procurement procedures. The report notes that, of the 32 recommendations drawn up by the Internal Audit Service (IAS), one recommendation, on the Agency's implementing procedures regarding experts, was classed as 'critical' and 12, relating primarily to human resources management and management of conflicts of interest calling staff members into question were classed as 'very important'.

I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must improve its budgetary and recruitment planning in order to redress the lack of consistency between its budgetary and staff forecasting, and to make progress in ensuring, as far as possible, a realistic evaluation of tenders.

It goes without saying that out of the nine recommendations of the Internal Audit Service (IAS), following an audit on financial management, four are still to be implemented by the Agency. These concern financing decisions, information needs for reporting and monitoring purposes, work programmes showing all available resources of the budget, and financial procedures and checklists. The Agency must take measures to implement the recommendations. The Court of Auditors has been able to obtain reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2009 are in all material respects reliable and that the underlying transactions, taken as a whole, are legal and regular. The Court of Auditors commented that the Agency could improve its budgetary and recruitment planning, notably as regards transfers between titles, the high vacancy rate (21%) and the high volume of appropriations carried forward. The Agency must take all necessary steps to improve the situation.

The Joint Undertaking is in a start-up phase and had not yet fully established its internal control and financial reporting systems by the end of 2009. The introduction of these systems needs to be completed immediately. The Joint Undertaking's utilisation rate for payment appropriations was 65.3%. I agree that the Joint Undertaking is still in a start-up period and that the underspending mostly relates to delays in the progress of the Euratom fusion programme, as was also reported by the Court of Auditors in 2008.

The objectives of the joint undertaking are to provide the contribution of the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) International Fusion Energy Organisation and to 'Broader Approach' activities with Japan for the rapid realisation of fusion energy, and to prepare and coordinate a programme of activities in preparation for the construction of a demonstration fusion reactor (DEMO) and related facilities including the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility (IFMIF). In addition to its other activities, the main tasks of the joint undertaking are to oversee the preparation of the site for the ITER project, to provide the ITER organisation with material, financial and human resources, to coordinate scientific and technological research and development activities in the field of fusion, and to act as an interface with the ITER organisation.

In the wake of the floods that devastated Pakistan in 2010, the Council called for emergency measures to support the country. I tabled an amendment rejecting the regulation proposed by the Commission, as trade preferences of this nature are a good idea in theory but not in practice. Our response to a humanitarian crisis cannot be based on trade, especially considering that it is now one year on from the disaster and the urgency is not as strong. This type of support is illogical and prejudicial, as some people in Europe, in particular those working in the textiles industry in several of the southern countries, will end up paying for support for Pakistan that we should all be paying for collectively. Furthermore, by only targeting certain industries, we are not helping all Pakistanis.

Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan's territory, the Commission's proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan (mostly textile and clothing) in the form of exemption from custom duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff-rate quota would apply.
<SPEAKER ID="436" NAME="Slavi Binev" AFFILIATION="NI">
in writing. - (BG) I fully support the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan. Trade preferences are hugely important to Pakistan because they will provide sustainable development to a country which has suffered several natural disasters recently. In addition to concluding the agreement with Pakistan, the European Union will have to play a key role in convincing India to support the agreement within the framework of the World Trade Organisation.
<SPEAKER ID="436" NAME="Maria Da Graça Carvalho" LANGUAGE="PT">
I welcome the aid given to Pakistan by the European Union, as the world's largest donor of humanitarian aid, following natural disasters that devastated the country's economy and population. However, the use of EU trade policy as a form of humanitarian and development aid is deeply flawed. In my view, the Commission should never propose such measures without having first quantified the economic and social impact on the various regions of the EU. One of the most serious results of these measures could be in Portugal, where the textile and clothing industry represents 11% of exports and 160 000 jobs, and would be hit hard by subsidised competition from Pakistan.
<SPEAKER ID="436" NAME="Marielle De Sarnez" LANGUAGE="FR">
In the wake of the severe floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of 2010, the European Union wished to provide aid in the form of exceptional trade preferences. Whilst the purpose behind this initiative is commendable, it is worth questioning how useful it will be in practice and to ask ourselves whether this economic aid will actually reach the Pakistani people, especially small-scale producers and farmers who have been particularly affected by the floods. The Commission's trade-based aid plan must go through a specific procedure: it must obtain Parliament's approval but also that of the WTO, since these trade preferences deviate from basic international trade rules. Parliament has just given the Commission the green light to continue talks with the WTO but has insisted on restricting their duration and scope. One might question the wisdom of choosing this slow, drawn-out aid procedure instead of other faster, more effective forms of aid that would have already reached Pakistan by now.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Anne Delvaux" LANGUAGE="FR">

<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" LANGUAGE="PT">
This report is on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan. In terms of humanitarian aid, the European Union always leads the way. That was the case last summer, when floods devastated a large part of Pakistan, with enormous human and material losses. In addition to humanitarian assistance in the first hours of the disaster, the EU also has sought other ways to support the economic recovery of the country embodied in the proposed regulation. However, we have to ensure protection against aspects that could damage some European trade sectors, namely textiles. In addition, I belief that 'trade preferences' are not the right way to help a country that is the victim of a disaster. These preferences may even give rise to a dangerous precedent. We cannot forget that the current economic and financial crisis has placed those companies most exposed to globalisation in a vulnerable situation, and it is not acceptable that 'trade preferences' could have a detrimental effect on them.
<SPEAKER ID="437" NAME="Göran Färm, Anna Hedh, Olle Ludvigsson and Åsa Westlund" LANGUAGE="SV">
We Swedish Social Democrats support the Commission's proposal to suspend all duties on certain imports from Pakistan for a limited time following the floods there last year. As the purpose of these trade preferences is to try to support Pakistan's recovery and future development, we believe that they should be offensive and far-reaching without safeguard measures for the EU, particularly as they are to be for a limited time only. We advocate respect for human rights, including the rights of workers, and for social and environmental standards and democratic principles and for this to always be included as conditions in a trade agreement. We voted against the extensive human rights requirements proposed in the report, as it is completely unreasonable to expect Pakistan to be able to comply with them before the trade preferences are intended to begin. Instead, we believe that the EU should have demanded improvements in these areas that could have been implemented quickly, particularly in view of the fact that these demands will be made if a trade agreement between the EU and Pakistan should be entered into at a later date.
<SPEAKER ID="438" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
As we have already said more than once, the tragedy Pakistan has suffered requires European solidarity. However, this cannot be a pretext for putting the textile industry of several Member States, such as Portugal, at risk. There are other ways of showing solidarity: more effective forms of aid, aimed at re-establishing the affected areas and improving the living conditions of the affected people; based on a policy of effective and lasting development cooperation and aid, which supports the integrated and sustainable development of local communities. There are also, however, more equitable forms of aid. These trade concessions mainly benefit the major European importers, who thus see long-held aspirations satisfied. On the other hand, they damage the textile industry and the countries and regions most dependent on it. All this against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis and high unemployment.
<P>
While it is true that there is no way the measures proposed by the Commission can be a pretext for new job losses and increased exploitation in European industry, at the same time, we cannot ignore the objective difficulties that they will create. The report acknowledges these, amongst attempts to 'sugar the pill' with the introduction of safeguards that do not change its substance.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Ilda Figueiredo" AFFILIATION="GUE/NGL">
in writing. - (PT) This is just another example of defending the interests of European Union's large companies and financial institutions, at the expense of industry in the countries with the most fragile economies. By introducing emergency autonomous trade preferences for Pakistan, the European Commission is bringing the narrow commercial interests of a few - business, pure and simple - into the field of humanitarian aid.
<P>
It is an exercise in hypocrisy, which uses the natural disaster that has devastated Pakistan to satisfy the aspirations of a few big companies in the EU's powers, which will damage the EU textile industry, and the countries and regions most dependent on it. It is a serious blow for a sector that has been hit hard by the liberalisation of world trade; that is concentrated in regions with high levels of unemployment and poverty, and little economic diversification, such as several regions in northern and central Portugal.
<P>
Therefore, we voted for the proposal to reject the agreement, and regret that it was not adopted. However, we also voted for it to return to the Commission, in the hope that it is still possible to take into account the position of the Portuguese Parliament, which adopted a resolution against these trade concessions. The necessary solidarity with Pakistan must be genuine aid based on development aid and cooperation policy.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Bruno Gollnisch" LANGUAGE="FR">
Last year, there were severe floods in Pakistan. The Commission's idea for financing reconstruction consisted in opening up EU territory to imports of textiles and other sensitive products without imposing customs duties or, in most cases, quotas, with no consideration for the threat that European businesses would face from this new one-sided competition. This alone would have been sufficient grounds for voting against this report. This House refused to reject the report, even though a clause was introduced stating that this special trade agreement may be ended if Pakistan is found to be supporting terrorist organisations.
<P>
It contented itself with postponing the final vote. It seems that we really do need to dispel the ambiguities as to where the Pakistani authorities really stand once and for all, whether it be on sheltering terrorists, helping the Taliban, especially in tribal areas, or persecution of Christians.
<SPEAKER ID="439" NAME="Juozas Imbrasas" AFFILIATION="EFD">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this document. Presented after the unprecedented floods that devastated last summer a vast portion of Pakistan's territory, the Commission's proposal seeks to extend autonomous trade preferences to this country concerning 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan (mostly textile and clothing) in the form of exemption from custom duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff-rate quota would apply. However, although the autonomous trade preferences would be extended to Pakistan for 3 years, a full impact assessment of the proposed measures has not been carried out by the Commission prior to the adoption of the proposal for a regulation. In addition, it should be noted that the Commission's proposal does not impose any burden on Pakistan in the field of human and social rights, contrary to what would have happened had GSP+ status been granted to this country. Although it might be argued that, due to the particular set of circumstances that led to the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan, the proposed measures will not create a binding precedent, this explanation is not entirely convincing. Indeed, it cannot be excluded that the decision to grant autonomous trade preferences for flood-stricken Pakistan may be followed by other similar initiatives in the future. Furthermore, there is a risk that adopting autonomous trade preferences decoupled from any kind of human rights conditionality would in fact undermine the current system of EU preferences based on the respect of a set of fundamental rights and values.

The EU proved this once again by rapidly making aid payments following the dramatic floods and their repercussions in Pakistan in 2010. As a next step, the Commission intended giving Pakistan a lift economically and guaranteeing that duties will be suspended on textiles and ethanol. This approach seems to be highly controversial. The fact is, however, that this initiative first has to be given the green light at World Trade Organisation (WTO) level. Only then should Parliament become active and make a decision.

in writing. - As is known, after the unprecedented and devastating floods in Pakistan in July and August 2010, the European Council at its meeting on 16 September mandated Ministers to agree urgently a comprehensive package of short-, medium- and longer-term measures which will help underpin Pakistan's recovery and future development. The draft regulation extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan. A list of 75 dutiable product lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established (mainly textile and clothing). The selected product lines amount to almost EUR 900 million in import value, accounting for about 27% of EU imports from Pakistan (EUR 3.3 billion). I voted 'in favour'.
<SPEAKER ID="441" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
in addition to promising over EUR 415 million in immediate aid, the EU is also responding to the flood disaster in Pakistan by means of exceptional trade measures to boost Pakistan's exports. The European Commission proposed a package of 75 tariff lines relating to Pakistan's main export sectors in the areas worst affected by the floods. Pakistan's trade with the Union consists mainly of textiles and clothing products, which according to information from the Commission accounted for 73.7% of Pakistani exports to the Union in 2009. In the EU's assessment, granting these trade preferences should only cause limited adverse effects on the Internal Market and should not affect negatively the least developed members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Notwithstanding this, it must be expected that the unilateral suspension of duties will lead to infringement proceedings at the WTO.
<P>
If Pakistan is allowed to join the ranks of those countries that enjoy preferential tariff rates - in other words, if it is to be included in the so-called 'GSP+' list - then the matter could be said to have resolved itself. Uncoordinated hasty reactions are hardly helpful. The textile and clothing industry in particular is in a time of crisis in a number of Member States as a result of transformation. Negative effects of the trade preferences cannot therefore be ruled out, which is why I rejected the report.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Vital Moreira" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (PT) I voted against granting trade preferences to Pakistan through exemption from import duties on the pretext of the floods that occurred last year. I do not think there is any logic in using exceptional trade preferences, against the rules of international trade law, as a means of emergency aid, which has its own instruments. The European Union has never done this before and nor have other countries. No other developed country has followed the same path: not the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand or Canada. Even if the advantages given to Pakistan were a kind of 'prize' for its role in Afghanistan, I believe using trade preferences as a political instrument establishes a dangerous precedent.
<P>
Moreover, the trade advantages given to Pakistan will be paid for by the European industries most affected, namely the textile industry of southern Europe, and also by the poor countries that export the same products to Europe, which will suffer from the diversion of European imports to Pakistan, for example Bangladesh or the countries of North Africa.
<P>
However, I voted in favour of the tabled amendments, which substantially mitigate the negative impact of the proposal: safeguard clause, limit of one year and the human rights clause.
<SPEAKER ID="442" NAME="Franz Obermayr" AFFILIATION="NI">
in writing. - (DE) Nobody is disputing that developing countries - such as Pakistan, which has been repeatedly devastated by floods - must be supported. Nonetheless, the EU must ensure that its partner countries in such trade agreements also meet certain requirements, particularly if duties are to be suspended. We cannot allow such suspension of duties to damage our domestic textiles industry - with the EU having not the slightest concern over whether these products are produced using child labour or whether the funds received go directly towards supporting terrorism. Wide-ranging duty exemptions must therefore be linked to an absolute obligation to respect human rights. I am thinking, for example, of Christian minorities and women's rights. The blasphemy law in that country is particularly worrying: anyone who insults Mohammed is sentenced to death. Fundamentalism is widespread in Pakistan across all levels of society - all the more so since the death of Osama Bin Laden - including among the students at the famous International Islamic University. The argument that the trade preferences promote prosperity and combat radicalism therefore does not hold water. The EU must not simply grant trade preferences where this ignores important matters of basic law. I therefore voted against the report.

Following the floods that devastated a vast portion of Pakistan's territory last summer, the Commission tabled a proposal to grant the country extensive autonomous trade preferences in the form of exemption from customs duties, affecting 75 product lines of interest to Pakistan: essentially textiles and clothing. This measure, presented as temporary, but for a period of three years, would have a major impact on Portuguese textiles, so I voted against this report. However, since the report has been adopted, I successfully advocated limiting the duration of the trade preferences to one year from the date these measures come into force, in order to minimise the repercussions on Portuguese textiles. The period could potentially be extended following a thorough assessment of the impact on European textiles, to be presented by the Commission. Finally, I also voted for - again thinking of Portuguese textiles - the introduction of a safeguard clause, which provides for the re-establishment of common customs tariff duties on a given product at any time if it is being imported from Pakistan under conditions that cause, or threaten to cause serious problems for an EU producer of similar or directly competing products.
<SPEAKER ID="443" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - The Greens welcomed from the start the idea of supporting Pakistan's efforts to overcome the hunger and misery following the floods. However, our main criticism was that it was a measure focusing on a country affected by terrorism without naming this political agenda, and without embedding the measures in a set of measures concerning the political context. Furthermore, the Greens feared that the measures might pave the way for the inclusion of Pakistan in the GSP+ scheme without the country having signed and implemented the corresponding labour and environmental conventions (let alone the Geneva Conventions). Finally, the Greens wished to exclude ethanol from the list of duty-free products, as it would be made out of sugar cane, which would replace food crops, constitutes a GHG-intensive crop and does not create a significant number of jobs. Unfortunately, none of the Green amendments was adopted in INTA. The text has finally been referred back to the committee.

The proposal adopted today came about after the unprecedented floods that last summer devastated a vast portion of Pakistan's territory. The final document intends to grant autonomous trade preferences to the country in relation to 75 product lines of interest (mainly textiles and clothing) in the form of exemption from customs duties, with the exception of one product (ethanol) for which a tariff rate quota applies.
<P>
The proposed measures should be welcomed as a perfect example of the synergies that the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon has made possible. The European Union and its Member States have already generously provided Pakistan with humanitarian aid, but the extension of trade preferences in this country is part of a larger package of measures that would address the medium and long-term economic consequences of the catastrophic floods.
<P>
Ensuring the recovery and future sustainable development of Pakistan is extremely important, not only for its citizens, but also for the security and stability of the region. A stable and prosperous Pakistan that is not subject to extremist or fundamentalist tendencies is obviously in the interests of the European Union.

in writing. - When we first heard in October 2010 of the Commission's plans to help Pakistan recover from its awful flooding by removing some customs tariffs, Greens were enthusiastic to help. We still are, but a once-simple idea has become over-complicated and unworkable. Originally the scheme was for 3 years, although we wanted longer to increase investor confidence. But after various business and interest groups had got involved the proposal was reduced to 12 months only - with quarterly reviews! Further, any deal needs a waiver from the World Trade Organisation, which they haven't approved as some member countries (notably India) are worried about the effect that duty-free Pakistani textiles would have on their own markets. There has been no progress in 5 months, and it's unlikely we'll see any soon, if ever.
<P>
In Plenary today I supported an amendment to send the whole report back to committee for re-working. In doing so I wasn't voting against helping Pakistan, but I was recognising the report before us simply wouldn't deliver what Pakistan needs. For me, a major stumbling block has been the WTO. I believe this organisation needs comprehensive reorganisation into a properly democratic, accountable and transparent body.
<SPEAKER ID="445" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
The natural disaster suffered by the people of Pakistan last August touched all of us and deserves the solidarity of the European Union. The European Union must show its support for Pakistan and help to minimise the devastating effects of the floods, as it has done through its policy of humanitarian aid and international cooperation when other tragic events have occurred. However, trying to use common trade policy to express this solidarity might have undesirable repercussions for the future, both in this specific case and in others that could arise.
<P>
At Internal Market level, the effects are negative for the production of European countries like Portugal. However, the effects at international level are also worrying, because they will create a waiver in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), in a key sector for many developing countries.
<P>
Therefore, and also bearing in mind that an impact assessment must be encouraged to assess the repercussions of the agreement inside the EU, I voted in favour of Amendment 43, which rejects the European Commission proposal to grant preferences to Pakistan.
<SPEAKER ID="445" NAME="Viktor Uspaskich" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
in writing. - (LT) It is time for the EU to reconsider its long-term trade programme. We cannot pretend that certain developing countries granted special status by the EU are the same countries they were a decade ago. Some of these countries (such as Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Saudi Arabia and Qatar) are currently the strongest economically. Meanwhile, countries like Lithuania are struggling to make ends meet. If Pakistan is granted trade preferences for textiles, as proposed in this report, Lithuania would find itself in a vulnerable position, as textiles account for almost 6% of all our exports. Furthermore, the EU should pay more attention to the situation of its trade partners in the area of human rights. Respect for human rights and democratic principles must be a fundamental element of EU trade policy. There can be no compromise on these matters. I am therefore concerned by the Commission's proposal to grant Pakistan autonomous trade preferences. Of course, the EU is keen for Pakistan to enjoy stability and prosperity, but in the face of the crisis we should get our priorities right. As events in the last few weeks have shown, Pakistan remains a hotbed of terrorism and extremism. The EU should be careful not to send out the wrong message.

The current system of foreign direct investment, governed by a myriad of overlapping and sometimes conflicting bilateral investment treaties (BITs) of the Member States has to be replaced - in a reasonable time span - by a new framework of modern EU investment treaties consistent with cross-cutting EU policy goals. I also support the rapporteur's position, which strongly supports the coexistence approach of the Commission's proposal for a regulation. It is undoubtedly essential that, by way of an authorisation process, the Member States' existing BITs remain in place and that, under clear conditions, Member States be allowed to renegotiate existing BITs, finalise pending ones, and enter into negotiations for new ones. Legal certainty will, however, remain a relative term as long as the transition of the investment protection regime is not completed, and given validity terms of existing BITs of Member States under international public law. I am voting for the report, with the caveat that there is a need to continue debating the matter so that it will have a better legal framework.

Since the Treaty of Lisbon, investment has been an area of exclusive EU competence. Parliament therefore initially gave its verdict on the shape of the future European investment policy. This is the report I myself drafted, which was voted on during the last part-session in April 2011. In Mr Schlyter's report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries. As in the vote in committee, I advocated a Community vision and stated that agreements that were already standing should be closely examined by the Commission in order to check their compatibility with the Treaties and with Union law and Union policy, in particular the objectives of the Union's external action on sustainable development. However, the vision that has prevailed in the end is a right-wing vision in which protection of private investors is given priority over these objectives based on the general interest. Unfortunately the negotiations that will now be entered into with the Council are not likely to correct our aim, in an EU in which the good of the Union as a whole is rarely able to withstand national egotism.

I endorsed this report, which provides for a transitional period for this competence to be transferred to EU level, which in future will help ensure a high level of protection for investors against arbitrary actions by third countries.
<SPEAKER ID="446" NAME="Vilija Blinkevičiūt" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report, because following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the EU's common commercial policy became one of the common EU policy areas where the EU is given exclusive competence. Thus investment policy, an area which falls under the common commercial policy, must also be coordinated at EU level. Currently Member States comply with partly overlapping but often conflicting bilateral investment agreements with third countries, and this hampers the objectives of the EU's common commercial policy, and the formation of the image of the EU as a single trade area in transnational and global trade. This report's most important objective is the smooth transition from investment policies pursued by Member States individually to a common EU investment policy, ensuring legal certainty for all parties, and agreements already concluded for participants in the transitional period, when the old legal framework is being replaced by the new regulation. Essentially this report addresses two fundamental issues - a timeline for the transition, and the cases and procedures for withholding authorisation to hold negotiations with third countries, which the Commission gives a Member State during the transitional period.

I supported this report by voting in favour because I believe that we need rules during the transitional period to ensure legal certainty and avoid conflicts and gaps in the law. In fact, Mr Schlyter's report arises from the proposal for a regulation of the Commission that provides for the exclusive competence of the EU on foreign direct investment, replacing the agreements put in place by the 27 Member States and also establishing a necessary transition period to be applied to existing bilateral treaties. Finally, I agree with Mr Schlyter on the importance of a fixed date to mark the end of the transitional period so as to safeguard the European economy's competitiveness and to provide investors with a clear picture of current and future regulatory standards.

The regulation is therefore the logical and only possible reaction for enshrining policy in the area of direct foreign investments as exclusive powers of the EU, which forms part of the EU's common commercial policy. The policy has the important role of ensuring a high level of legal certainty in a period of transition. I therefore wholly agree with the Commission proposal, which counts on coexisting agreements. It is essential for existing Member State agreements on investment to remain in force on the basis of the approval procedure, and for Member States to be able to negotiate changes to them under clear conditions, to complete the ongoing negotiations and to begin negotiations on new agreements.

It ought to be possible to coordinate and make decisions on Member States' individual investment policies at EU level.

<P>
I also requested that the Commission should present a report to Parliament and the Council, no later than five years after this regulation enters into force, on the situation regarding re-examination of existing bilateral agreements, relating in particular to the number of bilateral agreements that the different Member States may have renegotiated.

Without questioning the need for the Member States' existing bilateral treaties to remain in force, I agree with the rapporteur's position in the sense of ensuring a high degree of legal certainty during the transition period, and also with the three reasons for withdrawing authorisation for a bilateral treaty: 'conflicts with the law of the Union', 'overlap, in part or in full, with an agreement in force with that third country and this specific overlap is not addressed in the latter agreement' and treaties that might 'constitute an obstacle to the development and the implementation of the Union's policies relating to investment'.

The importance of trade policy and, of course, of investment policy as instruments for promoting the interests of a country and its people according to its specific characteristics and conditions are all too clear.

With the Lisbon Treaty, foreign direct investment has become an exclusive competence of the EU and an integral part of the EU's external trade policy.

It also lays down conditions on how, when and what it is possible to negotiate. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, foreign direct investment is included in the list of matters falling under the common commercial policy. In accordance with Article 3(1)(e) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (hereinafter "the Treaty”), the Union has exclusive competence with respect to the common commercial policy. Accordingly, only the Union may legislate and adopt legally binding acts within that area. The Member States are able to do so only if empowered by the Union, in accordance with Article 2(1) of the Treaty. That relationship will develop further as the Union exercises its competence in common investment policy with the main goal of creating the best possible investment protection system for all Member States' investors equally and equal investing conditions on third country markets. As the new investment policy will be developed in view of the transitional validity of bilateral investment agreements concluded by Member States, it should acknowledge the rights of investors whose investments fall into the scope of those agreements and should ensure their legal certainty. The Commission should take the necessary steps towards a progressive replacement of all existing agreements on investment with new agreements that should provide for the best possible level of protection.

The Treaty of Lisbon has brought us to this point of banning any form of bilateral investment in support of another country and putting all the power in the hands of the Commission, an unelected body.
<P>
I shall vote against.
<SPEAKER ID="455" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
We cannot expect that what has failed at the level of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) - that is, bringing light into the jungle of bilateral investment agreements - will be successful at EU level. An attempt has been made at a higher level to introduce comprehensive multinational regulations for Foreign Direct Investment, or FDI, that would apply to all economic sectors. In the longer term this will probably be more likely to achieve the aim, but in reality it depends on how it is actually organised. The problem is that binding BIT arbitration judgments based on international law could entail commitments to investors by Member States that give rise to EU Treaty infringement proceedings. For this there is still no solution.
<P>
There is just as little consideration in the report of the potential negative aspects of the investment policy, for example the fear among the domestic population of job losses and wage cuts due to outsourcing and the relocation of production. Direct investments are by no means the magic bullet they are made out to be. Certain developing countries have had to learn that the hard way. For these reasons I voted against this report.
<SPEAKER ID="456" NAME="Claudio Morganti" LANGUAGE="IT">
As a result of the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, Member States have unfortunately lost their prerogatives regarding the management of foreign direct investment, which has become the exclusive competence of the Union. Such a significant change requires transitional rules governing its implementation: the report that we voted on today seems to be an acceptable compromise, since it protects the agreements already concluded by various States on a bilateral basis and also lays the groundwork for possible new, bilateral agreements, though they must be agreed on.
<P>
The evaluation powers of the Commission are also well defined and limited, thus making it, de facto, less complicated for Member States who wish to continue their specific policy on foreign direct investment. For these reasons I decided to vote in favour of the report.
<SPEAKER ID="456" NAME="Maria do Céu Patrão Neves" LANGUAGE="PT">
I voted for this report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries. It is a case of applying Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy. In a world of global transfers of assets and capital, and as a logical consequence of the EU's common commercial policy, the investment policy of Member States also has to be coordinated and decided at EU level. This means that the present system embodied by a myriad of overlapping and sometimes conflicting bilateral investment treaties (BITs) of the Member States has to be replaced - in a reasonable time span - by a new framework of modern EU investment treaties consistent with cross-cutting EU policy goals. The transition to an EU investment policy, bearing in mind the risky and long-term nature of foreign direct investment, is a long and complicated process. It is extremely important to ensure a high level of legal certainty during the transition period.
<SPEAKER ID="456" NAME="Paulo Rangel" LANGUAGE="PT">
Since, by virtue of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the area of foreign direct investment is an exclusive EU competence, there is a need to provide the European Union with the necessary means to move from a disparate perspective to a harmonised approach. As such, there is a need to find solutions enabling us to prevent legal uncertainty during the transitional period, but without risking the objectives guiding Union action.
<SPEAKER ID="457" NAME="Raül Romeva i Rueda" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
in writing. - As we feared, the tight vote against us in the Committee on International Trade on the crucial Article 5 (review of Member States' existing bilateral investment treaties (BITs)) and Article 6 (the possibility of withdrawing authorisation for a BIT) of Carl Schlyter's report on 'Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries' has been confirmed by the vote in plenary.
<P>
We had made it easier for Members to vote with us by tabling amendments on Articles 5 and 6, going just halfway towards what we had wanted (and had lost at the committee stage). We thus left it to the S&D Group to re-table the original texts, in order to be perceived as representing the middle ground. Unfortunately, that strategy did not work out. We had a roll-call vote on this and we will analyse whether we nonetheless captured some support in the ALDE Group.
<P>
We also lost our amendments concerning better transparency rules. We won only one amendment, of minor importance, on the recitals, which was clearly 'granted' to us by the EPP and ALDE Groups in order to appease us so that the Greens/EFA position in the final vote would be positive. However, we chose to reject the report (which was approved by 345 to 246 votes).

in writing. - Earlier this year, I made some enquiries to the European Commission in response to press reports about shipments of toxic waste from Italy to Romania. Although no evidence was found for the shipments, what was clear from the outcome of my enquiries was that we could benefit from more regular inspections of cargo, as this would act as a deterrent to those involved in the illegal shipment of waste. Such measures may have an additional impact in the case of developing countries because they may lack the capacity to properly monitor incoming shipments and therefore prevent the entry of toxic material into their territory. We should give serious consideration to the benefits of thorough, regular inspections coordinated at EU level, especially in the case of shipments to developing countries.
<SPEAKER ID="457" NAME="Nuno Teixeira" LANGUAGE="PT">
Pursuant to Article 207(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the EU has competences in respect of foreign direct investment (FDI), as this type of investment is directly related to the new common commercial policy.
<P>
The Treaty of Lisbon came into force at a time when many bilateral investment agreements with third countries were coming to an end and no transitional arrangements had been established to ensure an integrated move towards future agreements within the exclusive competence of the European Union. I think it is a good idea to undertake a reliable evaluation of all the bilateral agreements currently in force with third countries, and to adopt a strategy common to all Member States.
<P>
As this report says, it is crucial that the rules laid down be transparent, be known to the main political players and be assessed within a maximum of 10 years. At a time when transactions involving assets and capital are becoming increasingly globalised, it is important that the European Union adopt a common investment policy in line with the strategy set out by all the Member States.

in writing. - (PT) I am voting for this report by the Committee on International Trade. I adopt its position at first reading, taking over the Commission proposal. I call on the Commission to refer the matter to Parliament again if it intends to amend its proposal substantially or replace it with another text.
<SPEAKER ID="458" NAME="Zigmantas Balčytis" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) I voted in favour of this report. The European Commission pledged up to EUR 500 million of assistance to Georgia at the October 2008 International Donors' Conference. The sources of the funding include both programmed funds under the envelope of the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) and crisis instruments, such as the Instrument for Stability, Humanitarian Aid and Macro-Financial Assistance. The Georgian economy is beginning to recover following the double shock caused by the military conflict with Russia of August 2008 and the global financial crisis. However, the balance of payments and budgetary position remain weak and vulnerable due to the blockade of most direct trade with Russia and marked reduction in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. I endorse the allocation of EUR 46 million in financial assistance to Georgia, which will help reduce the short-term financial vulnerability still faced by the economy, while supporting reform measures aimed at achieving a more sustainable balance of payments and a more stable budgetary situation.
<SPEAKER ID="459" NAME="Mara Bizzotto" LANGUAGE="IT">
There is a fundamental contradiction in the European Commission's proposal to grant further financial assistance to Georgia: it was the Commission itself that pointed out that Georgia's economy was recovering after the conflict with Russia three years ago, thereby insinuating that there was no need to 'assist' the Georgian Government with further funds to help the national economy in addition to those already provided in recent years. It is therefore not clear why the Georgian Government asked for more money, nor why the Commission immediately started working to mobilise nearly EUR 50 million. Given the internal political situation in Georgia and issues of legality and transparency in that country, we have no assurances that it will be well spent.
<P>
I voted against the legislative resolution which allows Parliament to grant EUR 46 million to the Georgian Government. There are many economic, financial and employment-related problems in Europe and there are many areas which are forced to deal with crisis situations for which the institutions could do much more. The Commission should move first of all to focus all possible efforts on solving the problems of our citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="460" NAME="Vilija Blinkevičiūt" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - (LT) The European Parliament approved the Council decision to activate the Commission pledge of EU funds to Georgia. Prior to adopting the decision, the Commission assessed Georgia's economic situation and the country's financial prospects in 2010-2011, focusing on the balance of payments and budgetary needs. The Commission considers that the activation of the second part of the macro-financial assistance (MFA) pledged in 2008 is warranted. The new MFA would help Georgia to address the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the global crisis. The new MFA should support the economic reform agenda of the government and policy measures to strengthen public finance management (building on those of the previous operation and of the EU's sectoral budgetary support operation). In addition, this assistance should help to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, in particular by exploiting the potential offered by the future Association Agreement, which aims at concluding a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the two parties.

in writing. - (CS) As a member of the European Parliament's delegation to the EU-Armenia, EU-Azerbaijan and EU-Georgia Parliamentary Cooperation Committees, I welcome the decision to provide Georgia with macro-financial assistance of EUR 46 million, in order to help stabilise the Georgian economy and cover needs in respect of the balance of payments stipulated in the existing IMF programme. I consider it right and proper that EUR 23 million of this sum will be provided in the form of grants, and EUR 23 million in the form of loans. It is important that the relevant measures which Georgia should take to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and other irregularities relating to this assistance are set out in the memorandum of understanding, the loan agreement and the grant agreement, which will be agreed with the Georgian authorities. In the interests of greater transparency in the management and disbursement of the funds, the memorandum of understanding, the loan agreement and the grant agreement should also stipulate the possibility of checks, which also means on-the-spot checks and inspections by the Commission, including the European Anti-Fraud Office. In addition to this, we should also count on the possibility of carrying out audits, including random on-the-spot audits by the Court of Auditors.
<SPEAKER ID="461" NAME="Maria Da Graça Carvalho" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (PT) I welcome efforts to promote prosperity beyond the EU's borders, because I consider our aid important in order for some third countries to be able to tackle their balance of payments crisis and restore the sustainability of foreign debt. Therefore, and bearing in mind the economic and social problems suffered as a result of the August 2008 armed conflict and the global financial crisis, I agree with the tabled proposal of additional macro-economic financial assistance for Georgia, with a view to supporting its process of economic stabilisation and covering the needs of its balance of payments. I also believe that this macro-economic assistance will have a positive effect on Georgia's relations with Member States, in addition to the critical role it will play in the country's government properly applying reforms.

<SPEAKER ID="462" NAME="Diogo Feio" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (PT) Georgia has faced serious problems recently, particularly after the military conflict between the country and Russia due to the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. We are still a long way from being able to consider the option of the country's accession to the European Union - repeatedly referred to by President Saakashvili - a realistic possibility, given that Georgia does not meet the objective requirements allowing it to aspire to such a desire. That said, I believe it advantageous that Georgia express this wish and try to comply with European standards.
<P>
As such, and since it is intended to seek to help the country overcome the economic and social difficulties suffered after the military conflict, I am voting to grant Georgia additional macro-financial assistance, which I hope can be used to the real benefit of its population.
<SPEAKER ID="462" NAME="José Manuel Fernandes" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (PT) This report is on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia. This is a European Commission proposal that provides for EUR 46 million in aid to this country and is the result of the armed conflict with Russia, a situation exacerbated by the global crisis. As this is the second part of aid guaranteed in 2008, which is intended to enable Georgia to meet the financial agreements with global and European financial institutions, as well as to support the economic reforms in progress in this country, I agree with this aid and am voting for it. However, I hope that Parliament and the Council will soon reach an agreement on the methodology for supervising the implementation of this aid, so that we all have greater peace of mind about the proper application of EU funds.
<SPEAKER ID="463" NAME="João Ferreira" LANGUAGE="PT">
With regard to this proposed additional macro-financial assistance, the observations we made about the decision to grant the previous macro-financial assistance to this country remain valid and relevant. We always advocate the EU's need to grant assistance in solidarity with countries that need it, and for this assistance to be directed at projects that serve the interests of the people. However, EU 'assistance' has demonstrated that it has little to do with solidarity. The interests of big companies and financial institutions, and of the major powers almost always overcome the genuine and real interests of solidarity.
<P>
It is no different with Georgia. It is important to bear in mind that the proposed financial assistance is intended above all to finance the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and its policy of structural adjustment: in other words, persisting with the same neoliberal policies that led to the economic and financial crisis that this country is facing.
<P>
We also maintain the same reservations and concerns with regard to possible progress in terms of the militarisation of the Caucasus region as a result of the tensions with Russia, bearing in mind the region's energy wealth and geostrategic importance, which arouses the greed of the EU and its monopolies.
<SPEAKER ID="464" NAME="Monika Flašíková Beňová" AFFILIATION="S&amp;D">
in writing. - Georgia has experienced a sharp economic decline since the outbreak of the military conflict with Russia in August 2008. This resulted in huge direct and indirect damage; a large part of the population was displaced. The global financial crisis which broke out in autumn 2008 made the situation in Georgia even more complicated. The proposed assistance - part of a comprehensive EU package of up to EUR 500 million - aims to support Georgia's recovery following the armed conflict with Russia, and also helps Georgia address the consequences of the global economic and financial crisis. The assistance is to be allocated to the financing of the deficit of the state budget, and may help Georgia to overcome its acute financial problems.
<SPEAKER ID="465" NAME="Sandra Kalniete" LANGUAGE="LV">
It is the duty of the European Union to continue helping Georgia, so that that country can develop and become a modern democracy, which could serve as an example to other countries in the region. Since the 'Rose Revolution', the Georgian Government has consistently implemented democratic reforms, modernising its country and carrying out difficult, unpopular economic and social reforms that are essential in the long term. As shown by the World Bank's 'Doing Business 2010' index, the business environment in Georgia is the 12th 'easiest' in the world. Only three European Union Member States are ranked above Georgia in this index. This country has had notable successes in fighting corruption, which is a significant problem in all post-Soviet countries.
<P>
I am convinced that Georgia is an example to Caucasian region countries, and I have no fear in saying that this country can serve as an example to some EU Member States that currently lack the political courage to carry out reforms that would pave the way to growth and modernisation. In solving problems associated with Georgia, we must not forget that 20% of Georgia's territory is still under occupation. Russia must honour its agreement with respect to the territorial integrity of Georgia, and the European Union must consistently continue to remind Russia's leadership of this.
<SPEAKER ID="465" NAME="Elisabeth Köstinger" AFFILIATION="PPE">
in writing. - (DE) Supporting macro-financial assistance for Georgia, which was hit hard by the economic crisis, is something to be endorsed. The money promised by the EU is linked to clear conditions and will reach the right areas. This financial assistance, together with the funding from the IMF, will help stabilise the national budget and will have a positive effect on relations between the EU and Georgia.
<SPEAKER ID="465" NAME="Krzysztof Lisek" LANGUAGE="PL">
I voted in favour of granting additional aid to Georgia. This country stands out from the other countries involved in the Eastern Partnership on account of the reforms it has carried out in every area. I am particularly glad to see that the simplified legislative procedure was used during work on the report on further macro-financial assistance for Georgia, since this speeded up the entire process and made it possible to vote the report through more quickly. Georgia's economy has recovered after Russia's military invasion of 2008, and has done extremely well in comparison to other countries of a similar size in the difficult times of the global financial crisis.
<P>
Since the Rose Revolution, numerous reforms have been carried out in Georgia aimed at liberalising and democratising the system in such a way as to make it more attractive to business, and to make it possible for a free-market economy and a democratic society to be established. Since 2004, Georgia has taken unprecedented steps in reducing the bureaucratic burden on businesses. Restrictions have been placed on the formalities necessary to start up in business. The tax system has been reformed, which has resulted in a five-fold increase in budgetary revenue. To sum up, Georgia has been opened up for free and unhindered trade.
<P>
Georgia has practically eliminated the cancer of corruption in state institutions and the civil service by means of a series of public sector reforms (concerning the public prosecutor's office, the judiciary and the police) and political reforms. Today Georgia is regarded as a country with a dynamically developing economy. In view of the above, we should continue to spur Georgia on to further development, not only by setting requirements, but also by granting aid.

It is in the European Union's vital interest to ensure stability at its eastern borders, which can be achieved through economic growth and political security. The package of macro-financial assistance intended for Georgia is in direct response to the economic and social difficulties which this country is faced with.
<P>
Although Georgia's economy is showing signs of recovery, it is still fragile and vulnerable, and requires financial stability. Last but not least, the macro-financial assistance granted by the EU supplements the other financial instruments and aid granted to Georgia by the IMF, as well as by international and bilateral donors, providing Georgia with short-term macro-economic support.

The European Union has found itself a new mission. It is now applying the savage cuts in the social funds of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), via the European Financial Stability Fund applicable to the euro area and indeed the whole EU, through macro-financial assistance (MFA) outside the EU.

In Georgia, the IMF has announced that it will not be continuing its 'aid'. There is therefore no longer any need to implement the IMF austerity plan. Through this MFA, the European Union is forcing Georgia to carry on implementing the plan regardless. This is unacceptable: I shall vote against.
<SPEAKER ID="469" NAME="Andreas Mölzer" LANGUAGE="DE">
Georgia faces series financial problems following the armed conflict with Russia in 2008 and the impact of the global financial crisis. Back in January of this year, the EU approved a EUR 46 million aid package for Georgia, of which EUR 23 million is to be paid as a loan and a further EUR 23 million in the form of a grant to the country. The EUR 46 million forms part of an EU financial aid package worth around EUR 500 million which was approved by the EU back in October 2008. This second tranche of the EU's macro-financial assistance - the first having been implemented back in 2009-2010 - is intended to help Georgia meet its external financing requirement and is subject to strict conditions. Initial signs of its success can already be seen in the fact that real GDP grew by 6.3% in 2010, providing evidence of a revival of the economy.
<P>
Nonetheless, it should be stated that there are indications that the money is not being used efficiently enough. In view of the budgetary situation of most EU Member States, this is unacceptable. Although I am fundamentally in favour of the financial assistance, I therefore abstained from voting in the final vote.
<SPEAKER ID="470" NAME="RadvilMorkūnaitė-Mikulėnien" LANGUAGE="LT">
I welcome the European Parliament's decision to approve the Commission's proposal to allocate a further EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia. This is significant support for a country loyal to European integration which will help mitigate two negative repercussions on the Georgian economy - the military conflict with Russia and the global economic and financial crisis. In order to increase the long-term viability of this assistance, the Commission must actively help to ensure targeted uptake, above all through measures to foster economic and financial integration with the EU, so that it would contribute to the swift conclusion of a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Georgia.
<P>
A dialogue on visas is another measure that would have a clear stabilising influence that would also promote reforms. The EU-Georgia agreements on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission entered into force on 1 March 2011 and represent a welcome first step. I trust that the Commission will soon present an evaluation of the implementation of these agreements, so that by the next meeting of the EU-Georgia Cooperation Council it is possible to begin discussions on the course of further cooperation on visa issues.

Half the proposed aid will be supplied in the form of subsidies and the other half in the form of loans. Additional macro-financial assistance should help assist Georgia to deal with the economic consequences of the conflict with Russia and the world crisis, and also support the government's economic reform programme.

Indeed, there is no EU-specific financing strategy apart from the standard IMF macro-economic reform agenda.

Further macro-financial assistance will help Georgia to deal with the global crisis, by supporting the government's reform programme.
