3. Comfort women (vote) 
<P>
- Joint motion for a resolution
<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="218" NAME="Charles Tannock  " AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
author. - Madam President, there has been a change in the PPE-DE voting list. I would recommend to colleagues that the change should be from positive to negative. On the original text, on recital B, there is a request for a vote on the original text by the UEN Group, and I am recommending to colleagues that we now vote to delete that paragraph, i.e. vote against. It currently appears as positive. We want to change it to 'against'.
<SPEAKER ID="219" NAME="Andrikienė, Laima Liucija" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Madam President, I should like to move an oral amendment so that the title of the motion for resolution would read as follows: 'Justice for "comfort women” (sex slaves in Asia before and during World War II)'.
<SPEAKER ID="220" NAME="Marios Matsakis" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Madam President, there has clearly been an alteration to the oral amendment, and the author is now in favour of that oral amendment.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 9:
<SPEAKER ID="222" NAME="Sophia in 't Veld">
author. - Madam President, we propose inserting the words 'as is the moral duty of all countries' after the first part of the first sentence, i.e. it would read: 'Encourages the Japanese people and government to take further steps to recognise the full history of their nation, as is the moral duty of all countries'.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
