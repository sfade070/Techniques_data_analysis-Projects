Mr President, in relation to the next two amendments, I am withdrawing our Amendment No 8.
<P>
In return, as discussed with Mr Swoboda, the rapporteur, and his shadows, we have an oral amendment to Amendment 7 which reads, 'in order to address remaining shortcomings with regard to the domestic prosecution of war crimes ... ' the text would then continue with that in Amendment 7 by Mr Swoboda.
