11. Situation in Pakistan (vote) 
<P>
- Joint motion for a resolution
<P>
- Before the vote on paragraph 1:
<SPEAKER ID="112" NAME="Robert Evans" AFFILIATION="PSE">
Mr President, I apologise for this, but colleagues will recognise that this situation is changing daily and the oral amendment is not quite the same as that listed on some people's sheets so I will read it out: 'Expresses its solidarity with the people of Pakistan who are victims of the violence perpetrated by the armed extremists; is deeply concerned for the safety of the 1800 or more people in the Red Mosque, some of whom were held as hostages; recognises the challenges the siege posed to the Government of Pakistan; expresses its grave concern about the still unknown number of victims and supports the efforts to bring those responsible to justice'.
<SPEAKER ID="113" NAME="Eva Lichtenberger" AFFILIATION="Verts/ALE">
(DE) Since the storming of the Red Mosque has now been carried out, should we not use the past tense, at least in the second part?
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
