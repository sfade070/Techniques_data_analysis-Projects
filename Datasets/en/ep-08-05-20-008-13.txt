on behalf of the PPE-DE Group. - Mr President, our group had intended to ask for three additional roll calls but, for whatever reason, they got lost in transit.
<P>
I would like, through you, Mr President - I have checked with the secretariat that it was in order to ask today - to have these three instated. They are on: paragraph 2, Amendment 4D; paragraph 6 of the original text; and finally, after paragraph 36, our Amendment 12. I hope you will appreciate that this is a very sensitive dossier and we would like to be able to place on record not just what we are against, but also what we are in favour of.
<P>
(The President established that there were no objections to this amendment)

- Before the vote on Amendment 5:
<SPEAKER ID="150" NAME="Sophia in 't Veld" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, we have been speaking about countries which have not adequately implemented or transposed the Anti-Discrimination Directive but there is one country which has not implemented it at all and therefore I would propose the following oral amendment: 'Calls on the Czech Government to effectively transpose the Employment Directive and for the Czech Parliament to overrule the veto of the Czech President'.
<P>
(The oral amendment was not accepted)

- Before the vote on Amendments 1, 16 and 17:
<SPEAKER ID="152" NAME="Richard Howitt" AFFILIATION="PSE">
Mr President, very briefly, I of course support your discretion in interpreting the Rules, but it seems very strange for the PPE-DE Group to want to introduce roll-call votes at the last moment after the deadline has expired because they say that they want to positively explain their case, when their amendments seek to delete - to delete - paragraphs from this report. I think that they are trying to cover up the cracks in their own group rather than actually say anything positive in combating discrimination.
<SPEAKER ID="153" NAME="President">
Mr Howitt, it is probably the case that the vote referred to was filed too late, but I did ask you, and in this respect you were too late in asking to speak. If you had asked straight away, perhaps we would have voted differently.
