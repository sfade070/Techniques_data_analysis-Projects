29. Defence of the parliamentary immunity of Mr Luigi de Magistris (
<SPEAKER ID="113" NAME="Sergio Paolo Francesco Silvestris" AFFILIATION="PPE">

I should like to know whether the vote we are about to take is the result of an automatic procedure or of a specific request made by Mr de Magistris, who has earned a reputation over the years for attacking the privileges of politicians, saying they should defend themselves in court and not seek loopholes to avoid it. Essentially, I should like to know whether Mr de Magistris asked for immunity or whether this is an automatic procedure.
<P>
Madam President, please can you clarify this issue, because if Mr de Magistris is seeking to avoid trial ...
<P>

<P>
I am told that Mr de Magistris requested the defence of his immunity.
