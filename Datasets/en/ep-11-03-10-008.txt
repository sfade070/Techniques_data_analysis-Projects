Mr President, in view of what we have just been speaking about, I would like to say that security in this building has been stepped up and I wish to extend our thanks to the men and women who protect us. I would like your reassurance that the investigation into Brussels security breaches, some involving firearms, is being vigorously pursued. These breaches have put our staff, our guests and ourselves at serious risk. May I also have your assurance that senior management will be held accountable where appropriate, and that these soldiers will not be sacrificed in order to protect the generals?
<P>
(Applause)

<P>
