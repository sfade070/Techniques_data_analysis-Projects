(FR) Mr President, yesterday, during the debate, Mr Barrot announced that he was in possession of a written version of the Commission position on the amendments tabled by Members, and I note that this document has not been distributed. I call on you to ensure that the Commission positions are made available to Members, since many Members are waiting to learn what these positions are.
<SPEAKER ID="108" NAME="President">
Very well, Mr Goebbels, we shall ensure that that happens.
