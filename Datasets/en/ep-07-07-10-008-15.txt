15. Energy Star (vote) 
<P>
Report: Nikolaos Vakalis

- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="131" NAME="Nikolaos Vakalis " AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
rapporteur. - (EL) Mr President, I would like to emphasise that a positive vote by the European Parliament today will be a huge leap forward and will break a taboo that has prevailed in Europe for decades.
<P>
For the first time, public money will have to be used, through public procurement, to increase energy efficiency, which is quite rightly considered to be a basic pillar of sustainable energy policy. I trust that this will mark the start of taxpayers' money being used for high-priority issues.
<P>
Finally, I should like to thank Commissioner Piebalgs and the German Presidency for making approval of the regulation at first reading possible.
