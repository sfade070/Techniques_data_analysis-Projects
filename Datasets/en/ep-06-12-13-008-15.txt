15. Russia-EU Summit (vote) 
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 6:
<SPEAKER ID="139" NAME="Konrad SzymaÅ„ski" AFFILIATION="UEN">
Mr President, I wish to point out that Amendment 9, tabled by the PPE-DE Group, is not contradictory to my own Amendment 6 and therefore I should like to ask you to put both amendments to the vote separately.
