33. Sakharov Prize (vote) 
<P>
- After the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="126" NAME="Edward McMillan-Scott" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Mr President, I received this information too late to add it to the resolution. Mr Gao Zhisheng, a distinguished human rights attorney in Beijing who was arrested in August, has been tried secretly this week and imprisoned. I am sure the House would wish to express its regret at that news, part of a continued crackdown on human rights activists in China.
<P>
(Applause)
