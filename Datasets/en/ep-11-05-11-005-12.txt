12. Exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the EU's Stabilisation and Association process (
<SPEAKER ID="127" NAME="Vital Moreira">
rapporteur. - Mr President, I have an oral amendment to my own written amendment. In Amendment 14, I propose to replace 'countries' by the expression 'countries and territories'.
<P>
The purpose of this amendment is quite straightforward. It is meant to align the wording of this paragraph with the title of the regulation itself. The title reads as follows: 'exceptional trade measures for countries and territories participating in or linked to the European Union's Stabilisation and Association process'. Without this correction, there would be a discrepancy between the regulation itself and its title. That is why I ask for your support and the adoption of this amendment.
<SPEAKER ID="130" NAME="Vital Moreira">
on behalf of the Committee on International Trade. - Mr President, I have a mandate to ask for the postponement of the vote on the legislative resolution.
<SPEAKER ID="131" NAME="President">
Does the Commission have something to say on this?
<SPEAKER ID="132" NAME="MÃ¡ire Geoghegan-Quinn">
Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission welcomes the Member's proposal. It will leave time for more examination of the amendments that were adopted, and will allow Parliament and the Council time before the first-reading vote.
<SPEAKER ID="133" NAME="President">
The report is referred back to the Committee on International Trade.
