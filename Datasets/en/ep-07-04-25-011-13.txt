<P>
- Motion for a resolution
<P>
- Before the vote on paragraph 13
<SPEAKER ID="158" NAME="Sophia in 't Veld" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, I would like to propose the following changes to paragraph 13. Firstly, that the word 'welcomes' be replaced by the word 'notes'. Secondly, that we add at the end: 'regrets, however, the lack of democratic oversight due to the exclusion of the European Parliament and national parliaments from this dialogue'. Finally, we also propose deletion of the word 'political' before 'framework'.
<SPEAKER ID="159" NAME="José Ignacio Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(ES) Mr President, I simply wish to say that my group would agree with two of the references: that of changing the word 'Welcomes' to 'Notes' and the removal of the word 'political'.
<P>
In order to be able to agree to this proposal, however, we would like to add a positive note and say: 'so as to give greater democratic legitimacy to this dialogue, calls for the European Parliament to be involved'.
<SPEAKER ID="160" NAME="Sophia in 't Veld" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
Mr President, I think that is acceptable.
<P>
(The oral amendments were accepted)
