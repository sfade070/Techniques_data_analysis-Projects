I declare the session open.
<P>
I am very pleased to have been elected: this is my first time as President of this House. I regard it as absolutely crucial and highly symbolic that I am opening this session with a debate on gender parity and equality. It must be said that our Parliament has made some significant progress, and I hope that it continues to do so.
