Mr President, I would like to inform you that after a debate yesterday during our PPE-DE Group meeting, we as a group are withdrawing three amendments: Amendment 6 to paragraph 9; Amendment 8 to paragraph 15 and Amendment 10 to paragraph 24. I inform you with pleasure, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, that those three amendments are withdrawn.
<P>

<SPEAKER ID="126" NAME="Emilio MenÃ©ndez del Valle" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(ES) Mr President, with all due respect, I must make the following comment.
<P>
Following the very proper and sensible address made on the Alliance of Civilisations by the UN High Representative, you resumed the sitting with these words - perhaps you have them handy - which were more or less as follows:
<P>
'Well, and now, following the Alliance of Civilisations, we must return to earth'.
<P>
Mr President, I regret to say that your comment was not in line with parliamentary courtesy and was inappropriate in your position as President.
<SPEAKER ID="127" NAME="President">
You must be aware that one of the President's powers - and my Vice-President colleagues frequently do this - is to make innocuous comments about incidents in the House. These comments must be taken in the context of their content and intention.
<P>
I can assure you, dear Member, that my intention was absolutely positive.
<P>
However, if you or any other Member has found something disturbing in this innocent and benevolent comment, you must regard it as having been withdrawn.
