author. - Mr President, I have several oral amendments. I can read them out together and then we can vote them all together.
<P>
In recitals A and C, replace the words 'civil war' with 'armed conflict'.
<P>
In recital N, replace the word 'PLA' with 'former Maoist combatants', and in paragraph 7 add 'former' to 'Maoist combatants'.
<P>
In recital D, replace the word 'terminate' with 'abolish' (the monarchy).
<P>
In paragraph 12 replace the word 'demise' with 'abolish' (the monarchy again).
<P>
In paragraph 9, replace 'CPN/N' with 'UCPN/N'.
<P>
In recital K, replace the word 'over' with 'close to', and adding as well the 30%, and add 'one of' to 'the highest literacy rate'.
<P>
In paragraph 1, add 'a permanent constitution'.
<P>
In paragraph 15, remove the last part of the sentence 'regrets, however, that its status as an independent body has not been enshrined by law'.
<P>
In paragraph 20, take out the word 'revolutionary' before 'land reform commission'.
<P>
These are all the oral amendments. I have the feeling that everybody agrees with them so this is simply for the record.
