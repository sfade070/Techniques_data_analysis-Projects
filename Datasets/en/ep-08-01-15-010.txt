The next item is voting time.

(For results and other details of the vote: see Minutes)
<SPEAKER ID="111" NAME="Graham Booth" AFFILIATION="IND/DEM">
Mr President, very briefly, I do not think you actually followed the Rules of Procedure correctly during the earlier voting session.
<P>
You said 'the voting is now open', but you did not ask 'have all Members voted?' before saying 'the voting is closed', and you did not read out the results.
<P>
I think you were out of order.
<SPEAKER ID="112" NAME="President">
Mr Booth, the result of the vote is on the screen. As you have asked for all today's votes to be roll-call votes, that is what we are doing; what I am trying to do is to make this form of voting as painless as possible for the House, if that is all right with you, Mr Booth.
