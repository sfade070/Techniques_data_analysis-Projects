<P>
- after the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="067" NAME="VÃ©ronique De Keyser" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(FR) Mr President, since we had some difficulties last time with roll-call votes on a show of hands, I would like to know why we have had a roll-call vote today, which is not even indicated on my voting list.
<SPEAKER ID="068" NAME="President">
Because a political group requested one.
