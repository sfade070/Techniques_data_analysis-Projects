rapporteur. - (HU) Mr President, my report called for extending the competence of the Agency for Fundamental Rights to the third pillar. I ask my fellow Members to continue to support this recommendation, and to vote for Parliament's original proposal. For my part, I have taken note that the political declaration contains this proposal to a slightly limited degree.
