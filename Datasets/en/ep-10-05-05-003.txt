Announcement by the President: see Minutes
<SPEAKER ID="007" NAME="President">
I should like to inform Members that a number of extra recording engineers using special equipment will be present in plenary during the course of this part-session. These engineers will record the debates and votes in order to produce a 360o panorama of Parliament's work.
<P>
This film will be shown as part of the permanent exhibition on Parliament's work in an interactive model of the Chamber in the new Visitors Centre in Brussels. I have been given clear assurances that the engineers will be extremely discreet and will not cause any disruption to our work. Thank you for your understanding.
