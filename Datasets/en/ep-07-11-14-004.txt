<CHAPTER ID="004">
Membership of political groups
<SPEAKER ID="144" NAME="President">
I have today received letters from Ms Daniela Buruiană-Aprodu and Mr Cristian Stănescu announcing their decision to leave the ITS Group. Parliament takes note of this decision with effect from today, 14 November 2007.
<P>
Taken together with the announcements already made this week concerning three Members leaving the group, I conclude that the number of members of the ITS Group has now fallen below the minimum of 20 Members required to form a political group laid down by Rule 29(2).
<P>
(Loud applause)
<P>
Parliament therefore takes note of the fact that the ITS Group no longer fulfils the conditions of the Rules of Procedure for the formation of a Group. As a consequence, the group ceases to exist with effect from the moment of this announcement.
<P>
(Applause)

(DE) Mr President, I should like to bring to your notice that, when I, like many other Members, was applauding your last announcement, Jean-Marie Le Pen made this hand gesture, signifying (EN) 'Fuck you!' (DE) directly at me. May I ask you to check that on the video recording. I believe such an action really must have consequences. I find it appalling that anyone should behave towards me in such a downright aggressive manner.
<SPEAKER ID="146" NAME="President">
Thank you, Mr Martin, I did not see it myself, but I take note of your point.
