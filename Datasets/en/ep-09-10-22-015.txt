(DE) Mr President, my apologies but, throughout the course of the day, I have listened to a right-wing Hungarian extremist speak about Hungary under every item. Please could you point out that we have an agenda with separate items. Perhaps the Member is unaware of that.
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="273" NAME="President">
Unfortunately, the Member is not present. I assume that she will take note of your comment.
