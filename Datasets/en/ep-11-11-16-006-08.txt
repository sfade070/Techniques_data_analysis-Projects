Mr President, I am the Liberal shadow rapporteur on this report. The Liberal Group would like to make an oral amendment. In the last sentence of Article 6(4), we would like to improve the text, adding only four words. After 'capital employed' we could add 'except from public funding'. I think that the other rapporteurs of the big Groups are in favour of this.
