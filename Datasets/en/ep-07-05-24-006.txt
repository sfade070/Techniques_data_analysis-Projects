Welcome 
<SPEAKER ID="250" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, It was on 15 April that I invited Garri Kasparov to come to the European Parliament, at a time when he was being held under arrest for eleven hours, and a member of my staff had other reasons - to do, in fact, with the legacy of Andrej Sakharov - to be in Moscow. I am glad that Mr Kasparov has been here yesterday and today, and I rejoice in the great support that you have expressed for him and for his friends in Russia.
<P>
(Applause)

Mr President, I would like to inform the House that last night the Israeli authorities arrested a number of elected representatives of the PLC, including a Minister of the Abbas Government. I would therefore ask you, President, to condemn this Israeli action and to make a strong statement against their practice of arresting elected representatives of the Palestinian people. This is not the way to go forward with the peace process.
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="060" NAME="President">
We have just been discussing this in the Conference of Presidents, too. Unless there are unavoidable changes to my schedule, I shall be flying to the Middle East on Sunday and seeking suitable means to express this.
