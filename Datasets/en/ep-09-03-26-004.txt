(IT) Mr President, just a short aside, as Members are still taking their seats.
<P>
We changed the rules of procedure because too much time was being spent on fruitless debates, and we decided not to hold a debate on the Auken report. We have wasted a good half hour doing nothing, which we could have employed much better by debating a text that is of great importance to citizens.
<SPEAKER ID="058" NAME="President">
Your comment will be passed on to the competent bodies.
