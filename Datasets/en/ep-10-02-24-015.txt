Welcome
<SPEAKER ID="113" NAME="President">
I should like to welcome Monsignor Jorge Ortiga, Archbishop of Braga, together with the bishops and the Portuguese episcopal delegation accompanying him.
<P>
Your Grace, may I take this opportunity to express our solidarity and our condolences to the people of Portugal, especially the people of Madeira, who have suffered greatly over the past few days. Our thoughts and our prayers are with them.
