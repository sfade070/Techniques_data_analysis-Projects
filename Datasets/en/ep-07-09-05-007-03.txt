<SPEAKER ID="103" NAME="Geoffrey Van Orden" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Mr President, as we have a delegation from the South African Parliament in the Gallery, could we ask them to take back from this House a message of condemnation of the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe and our expectation that South Africa should bring in appropriate measures to bring about change for the better in that country?
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="104" NAME="President">
I note your request, which I personally welcome, and we will try to deal with it while complying with parliamentary rules, as we conduct the votes.
