<SPEAKER ID="015" NAME="President">
Excuse me. It is very clear what the Minutes means in Spanish. It is extremely clear. We are talking about the approval of the Minutes, and I imagine that the interpreters are able to translate what we are talking about for you.

Mr President, I do not want to delay the proceedings, but Question Time at the last part-session was a shambles. I would ask you to ensure that it does not happen again. Question Time is being moved around far too often and Members are not being given the opportunity to do their duty.

<SPEAKER ID="017" NAME="President">
Thank you very much. We shall try to ensure that it is not a shambles this time, at least in your judgment.
<P>
