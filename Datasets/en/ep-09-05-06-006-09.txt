<SPEAKER ID="189" NAME="Udo Bullmann">
on behalf of the PSE Group. - (DE) Madam President, this report was strongly disputed in several Groups and, to guarantee the fairness of the vote, I would ask you to give me the floor before the vote on Recital 3 so that I can give my opinion on the voting order.
<SPEAKER ID="191" NAME="Udo Bullmann" LANGUAGE="DE">
Madam President, the report presents different ideas on how to regulate core capital and Amendments 91 and 92 go somewhat further in that they present a clearer and more precise definition of core capital, which will make less work for us in future. I therefore request that they be voted on first and that Amendment 89 to Recital 3 is then voted on. I hope that my fellow Members agree and I also ask you to accept that the vote on Amendment 89 to Recital 3 be taken by roll-call vote.
<SPEAKER ID="192" NAME="Othmar Karas" LANGUAGE="DE">
Madam President, I should like to point out that we made it quite clear in the debate that the amendments are clearly taken into account in the compromise in a sufficiently detailed form. I therefore request that we keep to this order. I have no objection to a roll-call vote.
