<SPEAKER ID="132" NAME="Horst Schnellhardt" LANGUAGE="DE">
Madam President, I would just like to make two brief comments. The translation may give rise to confusion in the different languages. I would therefore like to state for the record that the amendment made to Article 2(2)(a) with the wording 'except wild game' must always be considered in conjunction with point aa. This will remove the confusion.
<SPEAKER ID="133" NAME="President">
I can assure you that all of the linguistic versions will be checked in this respect, Mr Schnellhardt.
