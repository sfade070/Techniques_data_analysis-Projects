I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 17 January 2008.
<P>
The sitting cannot begin until 12.30 p.m., because the President of the Commission is unable to be present any earlier. It is therefore scheduled to end at 2 p.m.

(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 p.m. and resumed at 12.30 p.m.)
