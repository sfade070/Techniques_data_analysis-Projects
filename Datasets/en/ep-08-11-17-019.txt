Welcome
<SPEAKER ID="044" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, It is my great pleasure to welcome to the gallery a group of former members of the first freely elected parliament of the GDR.
<P>
This Parliament entered the history books when it resolved to reunify Germany, and then dissolved itself shortly afterwards. The delegation is headed by the President of the Volkskammer at that time, Dr Sabine Bergmann-Pohl. A very warm welcome to the European Parliament.
<P>
(Applause)
