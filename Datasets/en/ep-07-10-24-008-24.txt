- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="151" NAME="Martin Schulz" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(DE) Mr President, I have a request. I request that the order of voting on the amendments be amended under Rule 155(2). It is clear from the voting list that Amendment 51 is more far-reaching than Amendments 42 and 52, so I would ask that we vote on Amendment 51 first and then on Amendments 42 and 52.
<SPEAKER ID="152" NAME="President">
The Sittings Service is not in agreement, but I will ask Mr Davies to explain briefly.
<SPEAKER ID="153" NAME="Chris Davies  " AFFILIATION="ALDE">
rapporteur. - Mr President, very simply I agree with the voting list as presented to the House.
<SPEAKER ID="154" NAME="President">
That being the case, according to tradition we must following the advice of our rapporteur.
