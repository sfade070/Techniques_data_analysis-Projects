Welcome
<SPEAKER ID="389" NAME="President">

<SPEAKER ID="390" NAME="Elmar Brok" AFFILIATION="PPE">
Mr President, is it possible to find out whether Members of this House were responsible for the incident upstairs there?
<SPEAKER ID="391" NAME="President">
I think that if anyone has any information which might help the European Parliament to establish who was responsible for their entry, that is a very useful suggestion. Perhaps you would like to communicate with the President's Office.
<P>
I am going to continue.
<P>
They are attending the first European Parliament-Brazil interparliamentary meeting, which is a faithful reflection of the regular structured dialogue between Members of the European Parliament and the Brazilian National Congress, as foreseen in the joint action plan of the EU-Brazil strategic partnership. It will also provide a parliamentary forum for debating the state of play and prospects for the negotiations of the EU-Mercosur association agreement, with a view to guaranteeing the balanced and far-reaching nature of such an agreement.
<P>
You are very welcome.
