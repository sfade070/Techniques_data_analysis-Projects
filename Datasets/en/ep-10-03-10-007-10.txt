on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, colleagues have introduced an amendment which we could agree with if we combine it with the original amendment. I understand the colleagues and we share the view that our strategic decision should not depend on Russia, but, on the other hand, Russia is an important partner.
<P>
If the colleagues could agree that we take their amendment and say 'including Russia' - Russia is one of the members of the continental dialogue - we could agree and we could vote for this amendment.
