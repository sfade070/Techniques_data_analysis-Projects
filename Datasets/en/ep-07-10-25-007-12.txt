<SPEAKER ID="107" NAME="Alain Hutchinson" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(FR) Mr President, colleagues, I should like very briefly to propose an oral amendment to the new Article 61a in Amendment 1, which would introduce the following wording in the second part: 'therefore calls on the Commission [...] to find solutions while continuing negotiations'. I believe I have the support of my ALDE and PPE colleagues.
<P>
(The oral amendment was adopted.)
