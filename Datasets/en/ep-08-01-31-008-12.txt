12. A European strategy on the Roma (vote) 
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 9
<SPEAKER ID="111" NAME="Roberta Angelilli" AFFILIATION="UEN">
(IT) Mr President, I wanted to remove the words 'traditional practices' from the oral amendment, that is, the last two words of paragraph 9. If you wish I can read the text that remains: 'calls on the Roma to respect human rights, in particular with regard to women and children, avoiding forced marriages'.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted.)
<P>
(Amendment 9 was subsequently rejected.)
