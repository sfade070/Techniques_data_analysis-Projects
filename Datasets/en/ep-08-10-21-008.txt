<SPEAKER ID="127" NAME="Jan Andersson">
rapporteur. - (SV) Madam President, we are now running late. We have a lot of reports to debate, and the report that I am responsible for is last on the voting list. As it is possible that a lot of Members will leave the House, I would like us to postpone the vote on the Andersson report until tomorrow. I also wish to hear whether the other political groups support it.
<P>
(Applause)
<SPEAKER ID="128" NAME="President">
That seems reasonable to me.
<P>
Are there any objections?
<P>
That is the decision, then.
<P>
(The vote on the Andersson report is postponed until 22 October 2008)
