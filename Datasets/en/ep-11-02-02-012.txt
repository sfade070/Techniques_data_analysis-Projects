Mr President, I would like you to consider with the Conference of Presidents timetabling the one-minute speeches earlier, because in the last part-sessions this was pushed back to the last hour of our discussions. The general effect is that less and less people are inclined to participate and I would hate to think that this was indeed a reason for pushing it back.
<P>
So please consider timetabling this earlier to give us the possibility of participating, as we did previously.
<SPEAKER ID="021" NAME="President">
Thank you for your comment. Rest assured that we will hold talks on this matter and decide on the next steps to be taken in this regard.
