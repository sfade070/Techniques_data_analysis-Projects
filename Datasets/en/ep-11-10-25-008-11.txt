Mr President, I would like to move the following oral amendment to paragraph 7: 'Calls on the Member States to remove obstacles to workers' mobility by offering persons (the majority of whom are women) who follow their spouses or partners to another Member State, appropriate services such as courses to facilitate their integration into their new social and cultural environment, for example language courses and vocational courses'.
