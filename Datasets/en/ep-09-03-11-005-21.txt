21. Combating climate change (vote) 
<P>
Before the vote on paragraph 20:
<SPEAKER ID="141" NAME="Avril Doyle" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Madam President, a very brief amendment to the original text. Paragraph 20, line 3 should read: 'reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation'. At the moment, it reads 'reducing emissions for deforestation and degradation'. I want to change the word 'for' to 'from'. In the English version it is wrong. This is not contentious.
