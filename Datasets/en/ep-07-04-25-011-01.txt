- Before the vote
<SPEAKER ID="124" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik " AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
rapporteur. - Mr President, as rapporteur I would like to take this opportunity to make a clarification in introducing this report.
<P>
I wish to condemn and strongly oppose the behaviour of some of my shadow rapporteur colleagues who, by bypassing the rapporteur and presenting block one as a so-called compromise with the Council, are undermining the role of Parliament.
<P>
There are eight political groups in this House, but only three groups - the PSE, ALDE and GUE/NGL - have agreed on these over 70 amendments. We have not been informed by the Council that COREPER has accepted this package. I therefore urge you to vote to reject block one and support block two, which is the result of the work done by the parliamentary committees.
<P>
However, at the same time I should like to state clearly that I will listen to the voice of this House, and that as the main rapporteur I will give my definitive support to this proposal.
<SPEAKER ID="125" NAME="Dagmar Roth-Behrendt" AFFILIATION="PSE">
Mr President, I simply want to stress that I myself, and members of some of the other political groups, used their democratic right to table amendments in due time. I wish to underline that all of the amendments in block one reflect the votes in committee and are in line with an agreement reached in a technical trialogue with the rapporteur, who then decided not to continue with that trialogue. We did not exceed our powers in relation to any of those items and I would propose that we proceed to the vote. I always respect the democratic procedures applicable here.
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
Before the vote on Amendment 66
<SPEAKER ID="481" NAME="Hartmut Nassauer" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Mr President, I do not believe that Amendment 66 is covered by the compromise amendment, and would be grateful if we could have an additional vote on that.
<SPEAKER ID="482" NAME="President">
According to the analysis that has been done, Amendment 66 is covered by Amendment 127, which deals with derogations for hospitals. Therefore, we believe that matters have been voted on.
<SPEAKER ID="483" NAME="Alejo Vidal-Quadras" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(ES) Mr President, in order to ensure that the vote runs properly, I would ask you please, when you announce that a roll-call vote is starting, to leave a little more time before closing it, because some Members find it difficult to keep up with your fast pace.
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
So please allow for a few more seconds between opening and closing the vote. Thank you very much!
<P>
Before the vote on the amended Commission proposal
<SPEAKER ID="485" NAME="Miroslav Mikolášik " AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, according to my voting list, we should have also voted on Amendments 24, 35, 44, 45, 61, 62 in two parts and on Amendment 66, which we have not done. I would therefore ask you to put them to the vote, please.
<SPEAKER ID="486" NAME="President">
These amendments, Mr Mikolášik, have been covered by the first package.
