(ES) Mr President, I am sure this is because of how recent it is, but you have not mentioned yesterday's serious event in Cuba: it seems that a Cuban dissident, Juan Wilfredo Soto García, was murdered by the police in a public park in Santa Clara, Cuba. Mr President, I believe, given Parliament's sensitivity to the issue of human rights, that you should demand, at the very least, an independent investigation to shed light on the murder of this Cuban dissident.
<SPEAKER ID="018" NAME="President">
Thank you for your remark. If such an event has indeed taken place, we will adopt the same position as you have suggested. Thank you for calling attention to this.
