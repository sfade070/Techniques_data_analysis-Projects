The second Vice-President of the Pan-African Parliament and Chair of the Delegation for relations with the European Parliament. Our Parliaments work closely together, and your presence with us today gives us great pleasure.

I would like to take the opportunity to thank you for the invitation for me to address the sitting of the Pan-African Parliament which will be held in three weeks' time. Unfortunately, I will not be able to be there, but I will send you a letter on that occasion. I am sure we will have the opportunity to meet again.

Once again, I warmly welcome you all.
