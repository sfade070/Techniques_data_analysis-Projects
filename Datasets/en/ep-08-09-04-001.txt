Opening of the sitting
<P>
(The sitting was opened at 10 a.m.)
<SPEAKER ID="005" NAME="Bernd Posselt" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(DE) Madam President, just very briefly: some of our colleagues may not be aware of this yet, but it was mentioned to me that yesterday, it was decided that the next part-session will be held in Brussels. I have heard that there are tremendous problems getting beds here in Brussels as the hotel rooms are booked out due to a trade fair. This part-session should simply have been postponed or transformed into a mini-part-session. That would have been the best solution. With a measure of good will, that could have been done.
<P>
The second point which I would briefly like to make is directly related to this: has the safety situation actually been checked here in this building? I hear that there are major structural defects here. Has this building been checked using the same criteria as have now been applied in the Strasbourg building?
<SPEAKER ID="006" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, let us not start a debate on this topic now. Announcements will be made this afternoon at voting time.
<P>
All the appropriate steps are being taken to check the buildings on a preventive basis and to make the appropriate repairs at Strasbourg so that we can return there as soon as possible for our work.
<P>
We shall not return until we are sure that it is safe.
<SPEAKER ID="007" NAME="Philip Bushill-Matthews" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Madam President, I shall be brief, as I accept you do not want a debate. If there is to be an announcement at 12 o'clock, could that announcement also state whether the Bureau is considering - and I am not trying to be provocative - having a longer period of being in Brussels, so that we can have decisions in due time in order to get hotels and meeting rooms? Because these constant one-by-one decisions are not making life easy for any of us. Practically, could that be considered, and could we have a comment back in the announcement at 12 o'clock, please?
<SPEAKER ID="008" NAME="President">
Mr Bushill-Matthews, it is not Parliament's practice to change the sitting from Brussels to Strasbourg for no reason. There was a serious, unexpected reason and Parliament is attempting to deal with the matter with composure, determination and consistency. We must all show the same composure, seriousness of purpose and maturity.
<P>
Information will be provided when the facts are available and will be given in sufficient time to enable Members to book their rooms on site as necessary.
<P>
I think that what is needed to deal with this problem is maturity, the right attitude and composure. I do not consider this to be a serious crisis, as we have averted one that might have occurred.
