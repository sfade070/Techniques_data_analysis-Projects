2. Azerbaijan: freedom of expression (vote) 
<SPEAKER ID="285" NAME="Laima Liucija AndrikienÄ—">
on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group, I propose the following oral amendment to paragraph 7: the words 'deplores the Azerbaijani authorities' decision not' should be replaced with the words 'urges the Azerbaijani authorities'. The text should read as follows: 'Urges the Azerbaijani authorities to renew the FM radio licences of a number of international broadcasters...' and so on.
