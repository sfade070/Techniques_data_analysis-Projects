Opening of the sitting
<SPEAKER ID="004" NAME="President">
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the delay. There was a very exciting and interesting discussion between President Barroso, Commissioner Lewandowski and the leaders of the political groups, so we are a few minutes late. There is now a very important discussion ahead of us and I would like to invite you to this discussion.
