- Before the vote on paragraph 4
<SPEAKER ID="156" NAME="David Martin" AFFILIATION="PSE">
Mr President, very briefly, the PPE-DE Group has made paragraph 4 a fundamental issue in this report. We would have voted in favour of it, but not if they get a big consensus for the report. We are suggesting abstentions. I request that members of the PSE Group abstain on that paragraph.
<SPEAKER ID="157" NAME="President">
The House has taken note of this.
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 18
<SPEAKER ID="158" NAME="David Martin" AFFILIATION="PSE">
In order to find a consensus, we are suggesting that where the text reads 'it would be appropriate to revise the rules on trade defence measures', the word 'revise' be deleted and replaced with the word 'evaluate'.
<P>
(The oral amendment was accepted)
