<CHAPTER ID="005">
Election of Vice-Presidents of Parliament
<SPEAKER ID="041" NAME="President">
The next item is the election of the Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament.
<P>
I have received notice of the following candidacies:
<P>
Adam Bielan
<P>
Luigi Cocilovo
<P>
Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou
<P>
Mario Mauro
<P>
Edward McMillan-Scott
<P>
Luisa Morgantini
<P>
Pierre Moscovici
<P>
Miguel Angel Martínez Martínez
<P>
Gérard Onesta
<P>
Mechtild Rothe
<P>
Manuel António dos Santos
<P>
Marek Siwiec
<P>
Alejo Vidal Quadras
<P>
Diana Wallis
<P>
The candidates have informed me that they each accept their nomination as candidates.
<P>
Since the number of candidates does not exceed the number of vacant positions, the groups will not be consulted, and I propose that the election be by acclamation in accordance with Rule 12(1) of the Rules of Procedure, albeit with a subsequent vote to determine their seniority.
<P>
(Applause)
<P>
I therefore declare the candidates whose names I have just read out to be Vice-Presidents of the European Parliament.
<P>
I congratulate them all on their election.
<P>
The next item is the determination of the Vice-Presidents' seniority. Since all we need to do is to determine their seniority, qualified majority is not required for this vote, as they have all already been elected.
<P>
The voting slips are being distributed, so the voting is now open.
