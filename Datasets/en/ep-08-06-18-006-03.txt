<SPEAKER ID="123" NAME="Silvia-Adriana Ţicău" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(FR) Mr President, I would like to ask for a separate vote on Amendment 18 because it deals with the Agency's seat. I am thus calling for a separate vote.
<SPEAKER ID="124" NAME="Giles Chichester">
rapporteur. - Mr President, I object to this request. This report is a package which has been agreed amongst the groups. I do not think it is appropriate to make a request after the deadline and to open up the package in this way, so I ask my colleagues to join me in objecting to this.
<P>
(Parliament rejected the request)
