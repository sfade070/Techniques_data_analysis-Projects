46. 2008 discharge: EU general budget, European Parliament
<SPEAKER ID="075" NAME="Edit Herczog">
on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, we wish to move an oral amendment to the first part of this amendment.
<P>
The text would read as follows: 'Is of the opinion that, within an efficient and effective corporate governance system, due attention must be paid to the role of management; takes the view that Directors-General, Directors and Heads of Unit should be selected on the basis of merit taking into account equal opportunities and geographical balance...'.
<P>
So the oral amendment is to insert 'taking into account equal opportunities and geographical balance' after the word 'merit'.
<SPEAKER ID="077" NAME="Alexander Graf Lambsdorff" AFFILIATION="ALDE">
(DE) Mr President, for the purposes of clarification, can I ask whether we have just voted on Amendment 6 with or without the oral amendment?
