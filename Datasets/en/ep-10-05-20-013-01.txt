Resolution: Religious freedom in Pakistan
<P>
Before the vote on paragraph 13:
<SPEAKER ID="289" NAME="Bernd Posselt" AFFILIATION="PPE">
(DE) Madam President, our fellow Members have negotiated very skilfully and have agreed on a very good resolution with the groups. However, paragraph 13 is confusing and muddled and does not actually mean anything. This is why we are proposing a new wording, which reads as follows: 'Is concerned about the possible misuse of the 'Combating Defamation of Religion' campaign at the UN, stressing the Council conclusions of 16 November 2009'.
<P>
The content is the same, but the wording is tighter. We are asking you to vote in favour of this new wording.
