7. Climate change (vote) 
<P>
- Before the vote on Amendment 21
<SPEAKER ID="132" NAME="Dorette Corbey" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(NL) Mr President, according to our voting lists, Amendment 9 will lapse if Amendment 21, tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats), is adopted. I should like to ask that Amendment 9 be voted on in addition to Amendment 21, which stipulates 20% as a basis for sustainable energy and in our amendment, that of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, we advocate 25% by way of gradual increase. This could therefore be seen as an addition. If it is voted on additionally, I should like to ask our group to vote in favour of Amendment 21.
<SPEAKER ID="133" NAME="President">
As there does not appear to be any opposition on your part to Mrs Corbey's proposal, we are therefore going to vote on these two amendments.
