(DE) Mr President, there is an error in the Dutch version of the resolution on the Gallo report. I am listed there among the signatories to the resolution by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left as a member of the GUE/NGL Group. In this regard, I would like to say that, firstly, I am not a member of the GUE/NGL Group, I am not a Leftist and I am no Communist. Secondly, I remain a member of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe - a Liberal - and will vote for the ALDE resolution, as will many members of the other groups in this House. Thirdly, I call on the GUE/NGL Group to also vote for the ALDE resolution.
<P>

I have taken all of the sensitive issues surrounding intellectual property into consideration. I now feel that it is Parliament's responsibility to come to a decision. I do not see why we should give the Commission a free hand. Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore call on you all to come to a decision at least on this issue which will launch a debate and ...

rapporteur. - (FR) Mr President, I would again like to hold out my hand to our liberal colleagues and accept that paragraph 13 is rejected by all of the political groups that support the report.
