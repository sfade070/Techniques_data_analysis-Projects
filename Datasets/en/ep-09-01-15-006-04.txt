4. Situation in the Horn of Africa (vote) 
<P>
- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="081" NAME="Ana Maria Gomes" AFFILIATION="PSE">
(PT) I would like to propose a new paragraph before paragraph 1 that states as follows:
<P>
'Notes that the current situation in the countries of the Horn of Africa is not in conformity with the essential elements of cooperation stated in Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement;'.
<P>
This is a sentence that was already in the report that our three colleagues, who visited the region, recently gave to us.
