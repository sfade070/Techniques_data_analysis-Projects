Mr President, I know everybody wants to vote, but I would just like, on behalf of all the co-signatories - Ms Brepoels, Mr Buşoi, Mr Lehne, Mr Peterle and myself - to thank all of you who have supported our written declaration on the fight against colorectal cancer.
<P>
We have reached a majority one month before the deadline. This shows the importance of this issue, and we can promise you that this was not a one-off but part of a larger move targeting the EU and Member States. Colleagues, thank you for your support.
