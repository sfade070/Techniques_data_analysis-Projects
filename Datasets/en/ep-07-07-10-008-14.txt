- Before the vote:
<SPEAKER ID="127" NAME="Jan Andersson " AFFILIATION="PSE">
rapporteur. - (SV) I just want to direct Members' attention to the fact that Amendments 1 to 3 have been withdrawn in order to facilitate an agreement with the Council at first reading. Members of the committee have been informed of this measure.

I therefore move straight to the single vote.
