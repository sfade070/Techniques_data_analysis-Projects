Explanations of vote
<SPEAKER ID="260" NAME="Laima Liucija Andrikien" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
Mr President, when I spoke during the discussion on the Galina Kozlova case, I expressed my gratitude to our colleagues from the PPE-DE Group Mr Kelam, Mr Landsbergis and Mr Tannock for initiating that resolution. I was informed later that the original initiative came from our Estonian colleague Mr Savi from the ALDE Group. I should therefore like to express my respect and gratitude to him.
<SPEAKER ID="261" NAME="Marcin Libicki" AFFILIATION="UEN">
(PL) On Nigeria, I voted in favour of the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I do not consider it a good one, but I believe that adopting the joint resolution tabled by the Left would bring far more discredit on the House. I believe the resolution tabled by the Group of the European People's Party is a better way forward.
<SPEAKER ID="262" NAME="President">
I would remind you that there are no explanations of vote concerning emergency matters.
<SPEAKER ID="263" NAME="Zbigniew Zaleski" AFFILIATION="PPE-DE">
(FR) Mr President, I would just like to add a word to what Mr Libicki said: the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats's motion was not the result of a compromise.
<SPEAKER ID="264" NAME="President">
That concludes the explanations of vote.
<P>
Before closing the sitting, I have some more announcements to make.
