Announcement by the President
<SPEAKER ID="047" NAME="President">
As you know, on 15 June the European Parliament pronounced that it was in favour of the adoption of the euro by Slovenia from 1 January 2007. Certain technical adaptations are therefore necessary.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Treaty does not require it, the Council has chosen to ask for an opinion. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs took the view that a resolution by Parliament was not necessary for that opinion, and Mrs Ber√®s, chairman of that committee, has sent a letter to the President of Ecofin expressing the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' positive opinion of the technical adaptations to be carried out.
<P>
We therefore wish our fellow European citizens in Slovenia the best of luck with their new currency.
